<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<div style="max-width:660px;text-align:right">
<a href="releaseBreakdown.html">View Changes Separately for Each 2.5 Pre-Release</a>
</div>

<h3>NUnit 2.5 Final Release - Version 2.5.0.9122 - May 2, 2009</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit now uses a new version numbering scheme. The first three
    dot-separated values represent the release level, as before, while 
	the fourth is a build number tied to the date of the release.
<li>This release includes pNUnit, an extended NUnit runner for distributed
    parallel tests. The pNUnit program was developed at Codice Software
	for use in testing the Plastic SCM and has been contributed to NUnit.
	For more info about using pNUnit see the 
	<a href="http://www.codicesoftware.com/opdownloads2/oppnunit.aspx">pNUnit site</a>.
<li>The installer now offers Typical, Complete and Custom options. Selecting
    Typical gets you the NUnit framework, core, console runner and Gui.
    To install pNUnit or the NUnit tests select Complete or Custom.
<li>There are no longer separate distributed packages for .NET 1.1 and 2.0.
    Both the binary zip and msi packages contain subdirectories for .NET
	1.1 and 2.0. The Gui is now built for .NET 2.0 only. Tests may still
    be run under .NET 1.0 o 1.1 by running in a separate process. 
	In the case of the msi, the user may elect to install either
	or both of them.
<li>The Visual Studio solutions and projects are now in a directory tree that 
	is parallel to the source tree. A VS2008 project has been added and the
	VS2003 project was removed. Certain components are still built for .NET
	1.0 and 1.1 through the NAnt script.
<li>Most of the code for Assert and for elements of the constraint
    syntax is now generated. This allows us to more rapidly deploy new 
	constraints with their corresponding syntax. The file <b>SyntaxElements.txt</b>
	contains the specifications used in generating the code and the source of 
	a tool for generating the source is included in the tools directory. The
	generated files continue to reside in the NUnit source at this time,
	so that those working in other areas of the code don't have to regenerate 
	them each time they make changes.
<li>The nunit.framework.extensions and nunit.core.extensions assemblies have 
    been removed from the build.
<li>NUnit is now built using NAnt 0.86 beta 1. The windows installer is created 
    with WiX 2.0.5085
</ul>

<h4>Framework - Attributes</h4>

<ul>
<li>NUnit 2.5 features parameterized tests, which are defined using a number
    of new attributes:
	<ul>
	<li><b>TestCaseAttribute</b> allows the programmer to
		specify the arguments and a number of optional parameters inline.
	<li><b>TestCaseSourceAttribute</b> identifies a property, field or method
	    that to provide the arguments and other parameters.
	<li><b>ValuesAttribute</b> is used on a method parameter to specify
	    a set of values to be supplied as arguments inline. 
	<li><b>RangeAttribute</b> works like <b>ValuesAttribute</b> but lets
		you specify a range to be used for the arguments.
	<li><b>RandomAttribute</b> works like <b>ValuesAttribute</b> but lets
		you use random values for the arguments.
	<li><b>ValueSourceAttribute</b> is placed on a method paramter to
	    specify the property, field or method that will supply arguments.
	<li><b>CombinatorialAttribute</b>, <b>PairwiseAttribute</b> and
	    <b>SequentialAttribute</b> indicate how data supplied for
		individual parameters is combined to form test cases. The default
		is Combinatorial, which supplies all possible combinations.
<li>The presence of either <b>TestCaseAttribute</b> or <b>TestCaseSourceAttribute</b> 
    on a method is now sufficient to identify it as a test even if it is not
	decorated with <b>TestAttribute</b>.
<li>Test Cases specified using <b>TestCaseAttribute</b> or <b>TestCaseSourceAttribute</b>
    may include a Description, ExpectedException, Categories and Properties in
	addition to the arguments themselves.
<li>Parameterized test methods may be generic. NUnit will deduce
    the correct implementation to use based on the types of the
	parameters provided. Generic test methods are supported in
	both generic and non-generic clases.
	</ul>
<li>NUnit now includes an implementation of <b>Theories</b>, similar to what
    is found in JUnit. Support for Theories is provided by the
	<b>Theory</b>, <b>Datapoint</b> and <b>Datapoints</b> attributes and by
	the <b>Assume.That</b> method. For more information and further links, 
	see the <a href="theory.html">TheoryAttribute</a> 
	documentation page.
<li>Other new attributes provided in NUnit 2.5 are:
   <ul>
   <li><b>RequiresThreadAttribute</b> forces creation of a new thread and
       may optionally indicate the desired ApartmentState for the thread.
   <li><b>RequiresSTAAttribute</b> causes the test to run in the STA. A
       new thread is created only if the parent is not in the STA. On
	   methods, the .NET-provided STAThreadAttribute may also be used.
   <li><b>RequiresMTAAttribute</b> causes the test to run in the MTA. A
       new thread is created only if the parent is not in the MTA. On
	   methods, the .NET-provided MTAThreadAttribute may also be used.
   <li><b>TimeoutAttribute</b> is used to set the timeout for tests. When
       used on classes or assemblies, the timeout value is used as the
	   default timeout for all subordinate test cases. Test cases with
	   a timeout value run on a separate thread and return a failure
	   message if the timeout is exceeded.
	<li>The <b>MaxTimeAttribute</b> specifies a miximum elapsed time for a
	   test case. If the test takes longer, it is reported as a failure.
	   This attribute was previously available as an extension.
	   Unlike <b>TimeoutAttribute</b>, <b>MaxTimeAttribute</b>
	   does not cause the test to be cancelled, but merely times it.
	<li><b>RepeatAttribute</b> causes a test case to be executed multiple
  	   times. This attribute was previously available as an extension.
    <li><b>RequiredAddinAttribute</b> may be used to mark an assembly,
        indicating the name of any addin that is required to run the tests. If the 
	    addin is not present, the test assembly is marked NotRunnable.
   </ul>
<li><b>TestFixture</b> classes may now be generic. They must be marked with
    one or more instances of <b>TextFixtureAttribute</b> using the new
	constructor that takes an array of Types. NUnit will instantiate
	the fixture multiple times, using the type arguments provided.
<li>Use of the TestFixtureAttribute is now optional in designating
    non-generic classes that contain tests marked with either
	<b>TestAttribute</b> or <b>TestCaseAttribute</b>.
<li>More than one method may now be marked with the <b>SetUp</b>, <b>TearDown</b>,
	<b>TestFixtureSetUp</b> and <b>TestFixtureTearDown</b> attributes. Setups
	in a base class are executed before those in a derived class and teardowns
	are executed in the reverse order. If there are multiple setups or teardowns
	defined at the same level, the order is unspecified so this practice is
	not generally recommended.
<li><b>PropertyAttribute</b> has been modified internally to use a dictionary
    of name/value pairs rather than just a single name and value. This feature
	is not exposed for direct use, but may be accessed by derived attributes
	that want to apply multiple named values to the test. For a simple 
	example of usage, see the code for <b>RequiredThreadAttribute</b>.
<li><b>PlatformAttribute</b> has been extended to accept the new keywords
    <b>NT6</b>, <b>Vista</b> and <b>Win2008Server</b>.
<li>The <b>MessageMatch</b> enum used with <b>ExpectedExceptionAttribute</b>
    has been extended with a new value <b>StartsWith</b>, indicating that the
    exception message must start with the string provided.
<li><b>TestCaseAttribute</b> now supports a <b>MessageMatch</b>
property.
</ul>

<h4>Framework - Constraints</h4>

<ul>
<li>New constraints and corresponding syntactic constructs are provided: 
	<ul>
	<li><b>Is.InRange</b> tests that a value lies within a specified range.
	<li><b>Has.Attribute()</b> tests for the presence of a specified attribute
		on a type and optionally applies further tests to that attribute.
	<li><b>Is.InstanceOf</b> replaces </b>Is.InstanceOfType</b>, which
	    is now deprecated.
	<li><b>Is.AssignableTo</b> allows reversing the operands of AssignableFrom 
		for increased clarity in the code and in any error messages when the
		actual value is of the derived type.
	<li><b>Throws.Exception</b> allows testing the exception thrown by a
	    delegate in place and provides the ability to make arbitrary tests
		on the caught exception. <b>Throws.TypeOf()</b> and <b>Throws.InstanceOf()</b>
		are provided as shorthand for the commonly used <b>Throws.Exception.TypeOf()</b>
		and <b>Throws.Exception.InstanceOf</b>.
	<li><b>Throws.Nothing</b> provides for testing that a delegate does
	    not throw. While it doesn't do much, it serves the purpose of
		converting an unexpected error into a test failure.
    <li><b>Is.Ordered</b> allows testing a collection is ordered according
	    to a supplied comparison criterion. (contributed by Simone Busoli)
	<li><b>Is.SamePath(string)</b> tests that two paths are equivalent, without
	    requiring that they exist in the file system.
	<li><b>Is.SamePathOrUnder(string)</b> tests that one path is under another,
	    without requiring that either path exists in the file system.
    <li><b>DelayedConstraint</b> and the <b>After</b> syntactic element allow
	    delaying the application of a constraint until a certain time has passed. 
		See <a href="delayedConstraint.html">DelayedConstraint</a> for
		features and limitations.
	</ul>
<li>The parsing of constraint expressions written using the fluent interface
    has been reorganized internally, with the following benefits:
    <ul>
	<li>Meaningless sequences like "...Null.Null..." or "...And.Or..."
	    will no longer compile - the NUnit tests actually verify this
		by attempting to compile them.
	<li>Syntax modifiers like <b>Within</b> and <b>IgnoreCase</b> are
	    now only accepted - and shown by intellisense - on constraints that
	    actually make use of them.
    <li>New <b>And</b> and <b>Or</b> infix operators are provided.
	<li>The <b>With</b> provides some ability to group constraints.
    </ul>	
    <!--
	<p><p><b>Note:</b> Operators are evaluated in the following order:
	<ol>
	<li>Postfix modifiers (highest)
	<li>Not Operator
	<li>And operator (see below)
	<li>Or operator  (see below)
	<li>With operator
	<li>Some, None and All operators
	<li>And operator when followed directly by Some, None or All
	<li>Or operator when followed directly by Some, None or All
	<li>Overloaded operator &amp;
	<li>Overloaded operator | (lowest)
	</ol>
	Operators of equal precedence associate left to right.
	-->
<li>The "syntax helper" classes, <b>Is</b>, <b>Has</b>, <b>Text</b>,
    <b>List</b> and <b>Throws</b>, have been moved to the NUnit.Framework 
	namespace, so that they may be used more easily.
<li>PropertyConstraint now works with Types when testing for the
    existence of a named property.
<li><b>EqualConstraint</b> has been enhanced with
    several new modifiers, which may be used immediately after
	the Within(...) modifier to indicate how a numeric tolerance value
	should be interpreted.
	<ul>
	<li><b>Ulps</b> = as units in the last place (floating point only)
	<li><b>Percent</b> = as a percentage of expected value
	<li><b>Days</b> =  as a TimeSpan in days
	<li><b>Hours</b> = as a TimeSpan in hours
	<li><b>Minutes</b> = as a TimeSpan in minutes
	<li><b>Seconds</b> = as a TimeSpan in seconds
	<li><b>Milliseconds</b> = as a TimeSpan in milliseconds
	<li><b>Ticks</b> = as a TimeSpan in ticks
	</ul>

<li>The comparison constraints (<b>GreaterThan</b>, <b>LessThan</b>, etc.),
    <b>RangeConstraint</b> and <b>CollectionOrderedConstraint</b> may now be used 
	with 	objects that implement <b>IComparable&lt;T&gt;</b>.
    
<li>The syntax used for specifying that a collection is ordered has changed.
    <b>Is.Ordered</b> is now a property. The property name to use for ordering
	is specified using <b>Is.Ordered.By(name)</b>.
	
<li>The following constraints now accept a <b>Using</b> modifier to indicate
    that a user-specified comparer should be used:
	<ul><b>
	<li>EqualConstraint
	<li>GreaterThanConstraint
	<li>GreaterThanOrEqualConstraint
	<li>LessThanConstraint
	<li>LessThanOrEqualConstraint
	<li>RangeConstraint
    <li>UniqueItemsConstraint
    <li>CollectionContainsConstraint
    <li>CollectionEquivalentConstraint
    <li>CollectionSubsetConstraint
	<li>CollectionOrderedConstraint
	</b></ul>
	The provided comparer may be any of the following:
	<ul><b>
	<li>IComparer
	<li>IComparer&lt;T&gt;
	<li>Comparison&lt;T&gt;
	</b></ul>
	In addition, <b>EqualConstraint</b> may use:
	<ul><b>
	<li>IEqualityComparer
	<li>IEqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;
	</b></ul>
	Using C# 3.0, <b>lambda expressions</b> are also accepted.
<li>A new syntax element, <b>Matches(Constraint)</b>, allows use of
    custom constraints, predicates or lambda expressions in constraint expressions.
</ul>

<h4>Framework - Asserts</h4>

<ul>
<li>New Assert methods:
    <ul>
	<li><b>Assert.IsOrdered</b> allows checking that a collection is in
	    a particular order. (contributed by Simone Busoli)
    <li>The <b>DirectoryAssert</b> class provides tests on directories:
	    <ul>
		<li><b>AreEqual(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
		<li><b>AreEqual(string, string)</b>
		<li><b>AreNotEqual(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
		<li><b>AreNotEqual(string, string)</b>
		<li><b>IsEmpty(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
		<li><b>IsEmpty(string, string)</b>
		<li><b>IsNotEmpty(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
		<li><b>IsNotEmpty(string, string)</b>
		<li><b>IsWithin(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
		<li><b>IsWithin(string, string)</b>
		<li><b>IsNotWithin(DirectoryInfo, DirectoryInfo)</b>
		<li><b>IsNotWithin(string, string)</b>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Assert.Throws(Type expectedException, TestDelegate code)</b> 
		gives more control over tests of expected exceptions. 
		<b>TestDelegate</b> is a delegate, which may of course be supplied 
		as an anonymous delegate or lambda expression. If the correct exception 
		type is thrown, the actual exception is returned from the method, so
		that further verification may be performed.
	<li><b>Assert.Throws(Constraint, TestDelegate)</b> allows passing a
    	constraint or constraint expression as the first argument, which
		is then applied to the resulting exception.
    <li><b>Assert.DoesNotThrow</b> method tests that a
		delegate does not throw an exception.
	<li><b>Assert.Pass</b> allows early termination of a test with a
    	successful result. 
	<li><b>Assert.Inconclusive</b> terminates a test, returning
		the new Inconclusive result state.
	</ul>

<li><b>Assert.That</b> has been extended to allow a delegate or a reference 
	as the argument. By default, these are evaluated before being used by
	the constraint supplied but some constraints may delay evaluation. The
	new <b>DelayedConstraint</b> is an example.

<li>AssertionHelper has been updated so that the Expect overloads now
    include the signatures newly introduced for Assert.That.

<li>NUnit now includes added functionality in the .NET 2.0 build of
	the framework. The following additional features are supported:
	<ul>
	<li>All Asserts and Constraints work with nullable types. 
	<li>Some Asserts allow an alternate generic syntax for convenience:
		<ul>
		<li><b>Assert.IsInstanceOf&lt;T&gt;(object actual);</b>
		<li><b>Assert.IsNotInstanceOf&lt;T&gt;(object actual);</b>
		<li><b>Assert.IsAssignableFrom&lt;T&gt;(object actual);</b>
		<li><b>Assert.IsNotAssignableFrom&lt;T&gt;(object actual);</b>
		<li><b>Assert.Throws&lt;T&gt(TypeSnippet code);</b>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	
</ul>

<h4>Framework - Miscellaneous</h4>

<ul>
<li>The following obsolete interfaces, classes and methods have been removed:
<ul>
	<li>The <b>IAsserter</b> interface
	<li>The <b>AbstractAsserter</b> class
	<li>The <b>Assertion</b> class
	<li>The <b>AssertionFailureMessage</b> class
	<li>The old <b>NUnit.Framework.TestCase</b> class used for inheriting test classes
	<li>The <b>Assert.DoAssert()</b> method
	<li>Two <b>ExpectedExceptionAttribute(Type, string)</b> constructor
	<li>Two <b>ExpectedExceptionAttribute(string, string)</b> constructor
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Core</h4>

<ul>
<!-- Beta 1 -->
<li>NUnit now supports running tests in a separate process or in
    multiple processes per assembly. In addition, tests run in
	a separate process may use a different runtime framework
	from that under which NUnit is running.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> In the Beta release, execution of tests under Mono 
	from a copy of NUnit that is running under .NET is not yet supported.
<!-- Alpha 1 -->
<li>NUnit now allows use of static methods as tests and for SetUp, TearDown, 
    TestFixtureSetUp and TestFixtureTearDown.
<li>Failures and Errors are now distinquished internally and in summary reports.
    Methods that are not run because they are invalid are also reported separately.
<li>NUnit 2.5 is able to recognize, load and run NUnitLite tests.
</ul>

<h4>Console</h4>

<ul>
<li>The console runner now supports a <b>/framework</b> option, which
    allows running the tests under a different version of the CLR.
<!-- Beta 1 -->
<li>The new <b>/process:xxxxx</b> command line option is used to run
    tests in a separate process or in multiple processes per assembly.
<li>A new commandline option, <b>/timeout:nnnn</b> allows you to specify a
    default timeout value, which is applied to each test case in the run without
    a Timeout specified.
<!-- Alpha 1 -->
<li>The summary report now displays Errors, Failures, Inconclusive, Ignored and Skipped tests 
	separately. More detailed information on non-runnable tests and setup failures
	is provided.
<li>The console summary report is no longer created using a stylesheet, which
	renders the <b>/transform</b> option meaningless. The option has been removed.
</ul>

<h4>Gui</h4>

<ul>
<li>The Gui is now able to display the source code for test or production
    code from the stack trace, provided the assemblies contain source code
    information and the source code is available. Contributed by Ir&eacute;n&eacute;e Hottier.
<li>Reloading the tests after changing settings in a way that modifies
    the shape of the tree is now handled correctly.
<li>The Settings Dialog now opens to the page that was last viewed.
<li>The default gui display now uses a single tab for all text output. For
	users upgrading from an earlier release, the current settings are
	honored. If you wish to change to the new default, use the Restore Defaults
	button on the Text Output settings dialog.
<li>The tree display shows non-runnable tests in red and inconclusive tests
	in orange. Inconclusive tests are temporarily listed
	on the Tests Not Run tab for this release.
<li>The final test run display shows a more detailed summary: passed tests,
    errors, failures, inconclusive, non-runnable, skipped and ignored.
<li>The Project Editor now allows setting the ProcessModel and
    DomainUsage for a project to control how that project is
	loaded and run. It also supports setting a target runtime
	framework for each configuration. If the target runtime is
	different from the runtime under which NUnit is running, the
	tests will be run automatically in a separate process under
	the target runtime.
<li>The TestLoader settings dialog provides default settings for
    running tests in a separate process or in multiple processes
	if not specified in the NUnit project file.
<li>The Project Editor no longer reloads the tests as each
    individual change is made. Tests are reloaded after the
	editor is closed and only if changes have been made to
	the overall project configuration or to the active
	configuration.
<li>The Addin Dialog now shows an error message for any addin that
    fails to load.  (from 2.4.8)
<li>The Assembly Info display now uses a scrolling text box and has
    been enhanced to show information about the Process and AppDomain
	in which the test is running. It also shows two runtime versions for
    eachtest assembly: the one for which it was built and the one under
	which it is currently loaded.
<li>The status bar now displays errors and failures separately.
<li>Properties with a collection for a value are now displayed
    displayed as a comma-separated list in the properties window.
</ul>

<h4>Extensibility</h4>

<ul>
<!-- Beta 1 -->
<li>The implementation of constraints has been simplified so that it is now
    possible to provide modifier properties on a constraint without creating
	any additional classes. Such custom constraints can be integrated into
	the NUnit syntax by rebuilding the framework assembly.
	<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> The ability to create new syntactic
	elements without rebuilding the framework is planned for a future release.
<li>A simpler method of providing new data point extensions based
    on attributes applied to the parameter itself is now available.
    Such attributes may be derived from <b>ValuesAttribute</b> and
    do not require any special addin in order to work.
<!-- Alpha 1 -->
<li>New extension points <b>TestCaseProviders</b> and <b>DataPointProviders</b>
    allows addins to provide data for parameterized tests.
<li>The following extensions are included in the nunit.core.extensions
	and nunit.framework.extensions assemblies:
	<ul>
	<li>The XmlConstraint extension, which allows comparing two xml files
	</ul> 
</ul>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<!-- Beta 1 -->
<li>Loading a single assembly and then adding another assembly using
    the Add Assembly menu item was not working correctly.
<li>Reloading tests after settings changes was failing when the
    new settings changed the shape of the tree in such a way
	that the new tests didn't match the old ones correctly.
<li>The Reload Project menu item was followed by a prompt asking
    if the current project state should be saved first and making
	the reload work in an unexpected way if you answered yes.
<li>A class without a TestFixture attribute, containing only
    TestCase methods, without any Tests, was not recognized as
	a test fixture.
<li>Assert.DoesNotThrow was failing to display a user message.
<li>Xml documentation for Assert.IsNotEmpty and Assert.AreEqual
    was incorrect.
