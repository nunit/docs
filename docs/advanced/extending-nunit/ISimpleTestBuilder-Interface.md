# ISimpleTestBuilder

This interface is used by attributes that know how to build a single, non-parameterized test from a `MethodInfo`.
`ISimpleTestBuilder` is defined as follows:

```csharp
public interface ISimpleTestBuilder
{
    TestMethod BuildFrom(IMethodInfo method, Test suite);
}
```

`IMethodInfo` is an NUnit internal class used to wrap a `MethodInfo`. See the [source
code](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/blob/master/src/NUnitFramework/framework/Interfaces/IMethodInfo.cs) for more info.
The `suite` argument is the test suite that contains the method in question.

Custom attributes implementing `ISimpleTestFixture` should examine the IMethodInfo provided and return a single
`TestMethod` instance, as appropriate to that method. The BuildFrom method should never return null, even if the
specified method is not valid for a test. In that case, it should return a `TestMethod` with a RunState of NonRunnable,
in order to provide feedback to the user who placed the attribute on the method.

NUnit treats attributes implementing this interface specially. They are ignored if any other attributes are present that
implement `ITestBuilder`. This allows, for example, use of `[Test]` on a method that also has `[Combinatorial]`
specified, without any error arising. Such usage has existed in NUnit for some time and this special handling of the
interface allows us to preserve it.

In the current build, only `TestAttribute` implements this interface.
