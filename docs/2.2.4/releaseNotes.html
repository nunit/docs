<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<h3>NUnit Iteration Release 2.2.4 - December 14, 2005</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <b>/framework</b> option, introduced in NUnit 2.2.3, has been removed.
The same functionality is now provided by the <b>clr.bat</b> command file. 

<li>A number of tests, failing only on certain systems, have been corrected.
  <ul>
    <li>All tests now pass on Mono 1.1.10, with one exception having to do
	with FileSystemWatcher. That test is ignored for now, since the watcher 
	is only used in the Windows Gui. 
    <li>A race condition, which caused intermittent failures in the 
	EventPump tests, has been removed.
	<li>Some culture-specific tests have been corrected
  </ul>

<li>Common assembly info has been moved to a single file in the source.

<li>The release documentation has been separated from other information that may change 
over time. Only the documentation itself is included in the installed package, with a
link to the web site providing access to additional resources.
</ul>

<h4>Framework</h4>
<ul>
<li>Two new Assert Methods have been added.
  <dl style="margin-left: 2em">
    <dt>Assert.Greater
	<dd>Tests whether its first argument is greater than the second
	<dt>Assert.Less
	<dd>Tests whether its first argument is less than the second
  </dl>
  
<li>The ExpectedException attribute may now be used with a string argument,
representing the full type name of the expected exception. This eliminates
the need to have a reference to the assembly defining the exception and will
thus allow the test to pass across multiple versions of that assembly.

<li>When an error or exception in a test is followed by a second error in
the TearDown, both errors are now reported.

<li>A custom configuration file, specified in a test project, is no longer ignored.

</ul>

<h4>Console Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <b>/noshadow</b> parameter now works, suppressing the use of ShadowCopy
    for the tests. <b>Note:</b> This cannot be seen when running the NUnit tests
	themselves, because certain tests enable ShadowCopy in AppDomains that
	they create.
	
<li>The <b>/out</b> parameter is no longer ignored.

<li>The <b>/xml</b> parameter now bases a relative path on the current directory rather
than the directory containing the executing assembly.
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test methods inherited from a base class now appear in the gui prefixed by
the name of the base class. As a result, a test method in a derived class can
redefine a test method in the base class using <b>new</b> without crashing the 
Gui.

<li>Attempting to add a duplicate name to the Gui now gives a warning method
as opposed to throwing an exception.  

<li>Fixed an error that occured when creating a new project from the Gui.

<li>Fixed an error in the progress bar, which caused it to remain green when
encountering an ignored TestFixture.

<li>Provided an advisory message when an assembly that uses the 2.0 framework
fails to load under .Net 1.1.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit Iteration Release 2.2.3 - November 14, 2005</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>NUnit can now be installed and run under .NET 2.0 and used in 
conjunction with VS2005. A problem that prevented installation when 
.NET 2.0 Beta 2 was the only installed framework has been corrected.
NUnit 2.2.3 installation requires one of the following .NET framework
versions to be present: 2.0.50727, 2.0.50215, 2.0.40607, 1.1.4322 or 1.0.3705.

<li>As an alternative to the use of the config file, both the console and gui 
runners now accept an option <b>/framework</b>, which provides a simple way to 
run NUnit under any installed version of the common language runtime.

<li>Additional NUnit library assemblies are now strongly named: nunit.framework,
nunit.core, nunit.util, nunit.uikit, nunit-console-runner and nunit-gui-runner.
As in prior releases, only nunit.framework is installed in the GAC.

<li>Separate assemblies are now used for extensions to the NUnit framework and
core. Assemblies nunit.extensions.framework and nunit.extensions.core replace the
older nunit.extensions assembly.

<li>As of this release, the msi files no longer install a copy of the source. To
get the source, download the source package.

<li>Problems in the NAnt build having to do with attempted access to 
registry keys that may not be set in some systems have been fixed.

<li>Various image files, missing in the 2.2.2 source download, have been restored.

<li>Both the console and gui command lines no longer recognize '/' as an option
delimiter when run on Unix or Linux systems. This allows use of absolute
file paths as arguments to both programs.

<li>The documentation has been reorganized and is now completely converted
to HTML.

</ul

<h4>Framework</h4>
<ul>
<li>The NUnit core now creates an additional thread for use in pumping events
back to the GUI. This avoids problems that occur in earlier releases when the
system under test changes the thread context, as in the case of context-bound
objects. One result of this change is that it is no longer necessary to save
and restore the thread Principal when the test changes it.

<li>As an aid to those converting from csUnit, NUnit can now run test assemblies 
built against csUnit without change or recompilation. Assemblies using NUnit and 
csUnit attributes can be mixed in the same test project but only one framework 
may be used per assembly. The NUnit emulation has been tested by executing the 
tests provided with csUnit 1.94 and gives the same results (1 failure) as csUnit.

<li>Assert.AreEqual now succeeds when the expected and actual values are both NaNs.
[For the rationale behind this, see the extended discussion on the Yahoo 
testdrivendevelopment list]</li>

<li>A number of new Assert Methods have been added.
  <dl style="margin-left: 2em">
    <dt>Assert.IsNaN(double)
	<dd>Tests whether it's argument is NaN.
	<dt>Assert.IsEmpty(string)
	<dd>Tests that it's argument is the empty string.
	<dt>Assert.IsNotEmpty(string)
	<dd>Tests that it's argument is not the empty string.
	<dt>Assert.IsEmpty(ICollection)
	<dd>Tests that an array, list or collection is empty.
	<dt>Assert.IsNotEmpty(ICollection)
	<dd>Tests that an array, list or collection is not empty.
    <dt>Assert.IsInstanceOf(Type,object)
	<dd>Tests that an object is an instance of the supplied Type.
    <dt>Assert.IsNotInstanceOf(Type,object)
	<dd>Tests that an object is an not instance of the supplied Type.
	<dt>Assert.IsAssignableFrom(Type,object)
	<dd>Tests that an object may be assigned to an object of the supplied Type.
	<dt>Assert.IsNotAssignableFrom(Type,object) 
	<dd>Tests that an object may not be assigned to an object of the supplied Type.
	<dt>Assert.Contains(object,IList) 
	<dd>Tests whether an object is in a list or array.
  </dl>
</li>

<li>The StringAssert class has been moved from the extensions assembly into
    nunit.framework. It supports the following methods
<dl style="margin-left: 2em">
    <dt>StringAssert.Contains(string,string) 
	<dd>Tests whether a string contains an expected string.
    <dt>StringAssert.StartsWith(string,string) 
	<dd>Tests whether a string begins with an expected string.
    <dt>StringAssert.EndsWith(string,string) 
	<dd>Tests whether a string ends with an expected string.
    <dt>StringAssert.AreEqualIgnoringCase(string,string) 
	<dd>Compares two strings for equality without regard to case and 
	gives an error message showing the actual strings, without case adjustment.
</dl>
</li>

<li>The interface used for extending Assert has been changed from prior
versions. Extensions written using the older interface may require
modification in order to work with this version.

<li>The following additional information has been added to the XML output:
  <ul>
    <li>NUnit famework version
    <li>Common language runtime version
    <li>Operating system and platform id
    <li>Current working directory at start of the run
    <li>Machine name
    <li>User name and domain
    <li>Current culture and ui culture
  </ul>
  
<li>Special characters in CDATA sections of the XML file are now encoded correctly.

<li>Restored assert overloads erroneously removed from NUnit 2.2.2. These were
    removed because they were redundant when using C#, but their absence caused
	certain managed C++ and J# programs to fail to compile.
	
<li>Various bugs related to opening Visual Studio projects have been resolved.

<li>A problem has been fixed that caused TestFixtureSetUp and TestFixtureTearDown
to run between each test in certain circumstances.

<li>Exceptions thrown by the framework in attempting to access the stack trace
of certain COM exceptions are now caught and the stack trace is reported as
unavailable.

<li>Fixed a bug whereby an exception, thrown in the constructor of a TestFixture,
was causing NUnit to crash.

</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>

<ul>
<li>The project editor now allows setting an arbitrary AppBase. Previously, it
had to be at or below the directory containing the project file itself.

<li>The Options dialog is now divided into two tabs. An additional option has
been added to allow disabling the tooltip-like windows that appear over the
Errors and Failures display and stacktrace when hovering.

<li>The status bar now displays the full name of the running test, provided there
is room to display it. If there is not enough room, the class name is displayed
and a tooltip shows the full name when the mouse is held over that panel.

<li>The space bar no longer exits the application. This feature was originally added
to emulate a feature of VBUnit, but has been the source of numerous complaints by users.

<li>The application no longer crashes when attempting to save to a project file
marked as read-only.

<li>Fixed a bug that occured when custom exceptions were passed back to the GUI.

<li>Fixed a bug that occured in debug mode, when attempting to display stack
trace information from an ExpectedException failure, which doesn't report
a stack trace location.

</ul>

<h3>NUnit Iteration Release 2.2.2 - December 7, 2004</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>With this version of NUnit, all references from the core to the framework 
assembly have been removed. It is now possible to run tests built against older 
versions of the framework, either debug or release build.</li>

<li>The Assert class now provides an AreNotEqual method which gives an error if 
the two arguments are equal.

<li>A StringAssert class has been added to the extensions assembly. It provides 
methods Contains, ContainsAny, StartsWith, EndsWith and AreEqualIgnoringCase.</li>

<li>The logic for each type of Assert is now been encapsulated in a class that 
implements the IAsserter interface. Asserter object instances are created for 
each individual assertion. This allows creating extended asserts by implementing 
new asserter classes. Several base classes are available for extension. The 
StringAssert class discussed above provides a model for making such extensions.

<li>A PlatformAttribute may be applied to test fixtures or tests, causing the 
tests to be run only on certain OS or runtime platforms. This is still experimental and may 
change - see the source for documentation.

<li>Applications built with Visual Studio 2005 may now be debugged using NUnit. 
NUnit itself may now be built and debugged under Visual Studio 2005.

<li>Trace output may be directed to standard output by setting TestContext.Tracing 
to true.

<li>Solution files containing web applications now be loaded without an exception. 
The web application is ignored.

<li>Solution files containing projects specified using UNC paths may now be loaded 
without an exception. As before, changes to security settings are required to enable
loading tests from shares.

<li>An error in one of the timing tests was corrected.

<li>The xml results file now uses the correct standard format for date and time 
independent of the system culture.

<li>Classes in the nunit.util assembly that were specific to either nunit-gui 
or nunit-console have been removed. As a result, nunit.util no longer refers to 
the Windows.Forms or System.Drawing assemblies. The classes are now in the 
nunit-gui-runner or nunit-console-runner assembly as appropriate.

<li>The NAnt build scripts in each subdirectory are now directly executable for 
convenience in working on a single component and for testing the scripts themselves.
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio projects and solutions may now be opened by dragging them to 
the tree control.

<li>The namespace hierarchy is no longer ignored, with only fixtures displayed, 
when nunit-gui was run with /fixture: plus a namespace argument.

<li>The TipWindow displayed over the errors and failures tab in the gui was 
throwing an exception under certain conditions. This is fixed and further 
usability improvements have been made.

<li>Further cases in which gui controls were being called on the wrong thread 
have been identified and corrected.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.2.1 Iteration Release - October 26, 2004</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>Reorganized source code into separate components, each with associated tests. 
An NUnit project file is now provided to facilitate running all the tests together.
Config files are provided for running the project and for each separate assembly.

<li>Both the gui and console runners are now dlls for those who want to link 
them with their own programs. New exe projects simply reference the dlls and 
work just as before.

<li>An experimental extensibility mechanism is now provided, which allows uses 
to create special types of test cases and suites, marked by their own attributes.

<li>The nunit.core.dll assembly is no longer registered in the GAC. An assembly 
resolution event handler is used to "inject" the current version of the core 
assembly into the user's appdomain. The nunit.framework.dll assembly continues 
to reside in the GAC for easier reference by user test assemblies.

<li>The NAnt build has been revised to work with the new directory structure. 
It is now possible to use NAnt to build individual components and assemblies, 
without building the entire application. To do this, simply run NAnt in the 
individual directory. Note that you must ensure that any referenced assemblies 
have been built first.

<li>Tests may now be run without the source code being present.

<li>NUnit can now open Visual Studio 2005 projects and solutions.

<li>Old style test cases ("Test....") are no longer recognized by default. 
A setting in the test config file may be used to allow their use on an 
assembly by assembly basis.

<li>Added a protected constructor to Assert so those wanting to inherit 
from it may do so. 

<li>Fixed a buffering problem that caused test case labels to appear out of 
synch with the test output. 

<li>Fixed a problem causing shadow copies to appear in the root of the current 
drive if no config file was present or if the setting was not provided in the 
config file. 
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>

<li>Code that fires events has been modified to ensure that controls are invoked 
on the correct thread. We believe this will solve many of the problems that occur 
when running tests under the VS 2005 debugger. However, we have not completed 
testing in this environment, so some problems may still be present.

<li>Fixed a problem causing the console output tab to contain old data if the 
tab had not been selected during the prior test run.

<li>Fixed a number of problems with the tipwindow used to display error details 
that don't fit in the normal display area.

<li>Fixed a problem whereby only the first of several selected tests run was 
expanded in the gui at completion of the run.
</ul>

<h4>Further Documentation</h4>
<ul>
<li>The included documentation has not changed substantially from NUnit 2.2. The following files in the doc directory provide additional information about changes in this iteration.
 <ul>
 <li>Installation.txt
 <li>TestConfig.txt
 <li>Extensibility.txt
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.2 - August 8, 2004</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>NUnit 2.2 is available in separate Microsoft .NET and Mono distributions. 
The .NET version can run under Microsoft .NET 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0. The Mono 
version runs under Mono 1.0. The Microsoft distribution is built using 
Visual Studio 2003. The Mono version is limited to use of nunit-console 
to run tests. Note that Mono is distributed with a version of NUnit 
pre-installed. It may be necessary replace some of the installed
components in order to get a newer version of NUnit to work. A note 
will be published when we have more information on this issue.

<li>Separate config files for each .NET version are no longer needed. Instead, 
binding redirects are provided in each config which apply when running under 
version 1.0 or 2.0 of hte .NET framework. By default, the highest level of
the framework installed is used. The user may edit the config file if a
different preference is desired.

<li>The NUnit framework and core are now in separate assemblies, both of
which are installed in the GAC. The framework assembly contains all 
types that are normally referenced by tests, while the core contains
those types used by the gui and console runners to execute those
tests. Tests requiring use of core types - TestSuite, for example -
will need to add a reference to the nunit.core.dll assembly.

<li>The NAnt build script now supports building NUnit using version 1.0, 1.1 
or 2.0 of the .NET framework or with Mono 1.0. The Mono build is limited
to those assemblies used under Mono.

<li>Assert.AreEqual has been extended to allow comparison of two arrays. 
To compare as equal, the arrays must be of the same or compatible types, 
contain the same number of elements and each pair of elements 
must compare as equal.

<li>All Assert methods that take an optional message argument now also may 
take an optional array of objects to be used in formatting the message.

<li>An Assert.Ignore method has been added, which allows individual test 
cases to be ignored dynamically - for example, on the basis of products 
installed on the test system. Assert.Ignore may also be called from a 
SetUp or TestFixtureSetUp method. In the latter case, all the tests are 
ignored.

<li>Failure in TestFixtureSetUp or TestFixtureCleanUp now results in an error, 
rather than in ignoring all the tests.

<li>The core interfaces used to run tests have been changed substantially. 
These will continue to change to some extent as we attempt to reach a 
stable set of interfaces for use by third-party clients that run tests 
through NUnit. In particular, the interfaces now support passing in an 
array of tests to be run and return an array of test results. Other 
new features described in this document have required interface 
changes as well.

<li>There is a new CategoryAttribute which allows test fixtures and methods 
to be grouped into one or more categories using strings as identifiers. 
Support is provided for running only those tests in selected categories
or all tests except those in selected categories.

<li>A new ExplicitAttribute designates a test case or fixture that should
only be run when explicitly chosen by the user - selected directly or
included by means of a Category selection. It will not be run merely
because its parent suite is selected.

<li>Tests may now be run using a filter. Currently, this support is used 
only by the new Category feature, but it is intended to be of general 
application for clients and - eventually - users.

<li>NUnit now recognizes when the loaded tests were built using an earlier 
version of the nunit framework and issues an appropriate message. 
Earlier versions simply failed to show any tests present in the assembly.

<li>NUnit now captures and issues a message when a worker thread, created 
during the running of a test, throws an exception. Previously, such 
exceptions were silently ignored.

<li>The XML output from a test run now shows the number of Asserts executed 
by each test. 

<li>When a test with ExpectedException fails because of an Assert, the 
message from the assert is now given priority over the message 
indicating that the wrong type of exception was thrown.

<li>Private SetUp and TearDown methods are now ignored as intended.

<li>SetUp and TearDown are no longer executed for ignored tests.

<li>The documentation is now provided as a set of HTML files.
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tree of tests now optionally displays checkboxes. These may be used 
to select multiple tests to be run. Buttons allow clearing all checkboxes 
and checking only failing tests.

<li>There is now an option to display the name of each test in the standard output.

<li>The thread used to run tests is now created in the test AppDomain. The 
priority and apartment state for this thread may now be specified in 
the config file for the test. A separate configuration section is now
used for NUnit settings, to avoid name collision with settings required 
by the application under test.

<li>Command-line options are provided to allow the gui to load and begin 
running a test suite and to load a specific fixture from an assembly.
The properties dialog now shows the number of asserts executed for 
each test and any description associated with a test.

<li>A cancel button has been added to the project save dialog that appears 
on shutdown.

<li>The display of the last exception is now scrollable, allowing the 
entire stack to be seen.
</ul>

<h4>Console Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>The console program has been reorganized to remove differences in how 
tests are run between the console and gui runners.

<li>The console interface command line parameters now include provision for
selecting or excluding tests based on category, for displaying the name
of each test in the standard output and for redirecting standard or
error output from tests to a file. 

<li>The /noshadow option eliminates creation of a shadow copy and the /thread 
option causes the console tests to be run on a separate thread. When a 
separate thread is used, the config file settings for apartment state 
will be honored.

<li>A namespace may now be specified after /fixture and all tests in that 
namespace will be executed.
</ul>

<h4>Mock Objects</h4>
<ul>
<li>This version of NUnit comes with a built-in, lightweight mock object 
facility. The functions provided include dynamic creation of an 
implementation of any interface or MBR class, setting of expectations, 
specification of return values and verification that the expected 
actions occurred.

<li>This facility is in no way a replacement for full-fledged mock 
frameworks such as NMock and is not expected to add significant 
features in upcoming releases. Its primary purpose is to support 
NUnit's own tests. We wanted to do that without the need to choose a
particular mock framework and without having to deal with versioning 
issues outside of NUnit itself.

<li>At the same time, we hope that easy availability of a minimal mock 
object facility will inspire users who are not familiar with mock 
objects to experiment with them using our built-in facility and to 
migrate to a more complete framework as your needs call for it.
</ul>

<h4>Limitations</h4>

<ul>
<li>The CategoryAttribute was originally designed to have an Explicit 
property. This was included in some early releases and is described in
the Pragmatic Programmers' recent book. This property has been removed
and is replaced by the ExplicitAttribute, which can be used in
conjunction with Category to achieve the same effect as shown in
their examples.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.1 - September 1, 2003</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>The distributed version of NUnit 2.1 is now built using Visual Studio 2003 The solution and
project files in this Beta can only be loaded by Visual Studio 2003. Those needing to build
with Visual Studio 2002 will need to convert the project, solution and resx files.
NUnit can run against .NET framework versions 1.0 or 1.1. Separate config files are provided for
using either version. The install detects the highest version installed and sets up the config for
that version.

<li>NUnit now supports loading and running tests across multiple assemblies in both the console and
the GUI. This may be done on an adhoc basis or by creating NUnit test projects saved in files
of type NUnit.

<li>Information about one or more test assemblies may now be persisted as NUnit Test Projects.
This is a file of type .nunit in XML format which supports the definition of multiple
configurations each containing one or more assemblies.

<li>TestFixtureSetUp and TestFixtureTearDown attributes are now recognized. Methods marked
with these attributes will be run before and after the tests in a fixture. Unlike the standard
SetUp and TearDown attributes, these methods are invoked only once, before and after all the
tests are run.

<li>The Assertion class is now deprecated and has been replaced with the Assert class supporting
a new set of static method names.

<li>The reporting of test failures and errors provides more information. The specific type of an
exception is reported as well as any inner exceptions. Exceptions in TearDown no longer hide
the original test exception.

<li>NUnit now runs under Windows 98 and ME. Automatic reload of changed assemblies is
disabled in non-NT environments.
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are a number of additional menu items. [Specify]

<li>The GUI interface now runs tests on a separate thread. This allows the tree display to update as
execution proceeds. A Stop button now allows cancelling a test run. An option to cancel the
run is also displayed if the user attempts to exit while a test is running.
The GUI test threads run in the MTA by default. A configuration file setting may be used to run
them in an STA.

<li>XML output from a test run may now be saved using the Tools | Save Results as XML... menu
item. The format is the same as that used by the Console runner.

<li>When an exception occurs while trying to load, unload or run a test, the complete stack trace for
that exception is available through the Tools | Exception Details... menu item.

<li>The Tools | Options... menu item allows setting a number of options. [Specify]

<li>Automatic reloading of test assemblies may now be disabled. An alternate approach of reloading
assemblies whenever a run begins is also available as an option.

<li>If Visual Studio support is enabled, Visual Studio project and solution files may be opened and
Visual Studio projects may be added to an NUnit test project. Currently, C#, VB.NET, J# and
managed C++ projects are supported.

<li>When a Visual Studio or NUnit project is loaded, the user may switch between the available
configurations causing the tests to be reloaded. A Configuration Editor allows adding,
deleting or renaming configurations.

<li>The GUI allows creating and modifying NUnit Test Projects through the Project Editor.
A Properties window is now availble to display information about any test in the tree. It may be
pinned to allow quickly examining the results of different tests.

<li>Window layout has been streamlined, eliminating one splitter and reducing the area above the
tabs to the minimum size needed.

<li>The File | Recent Assemblies menu item is now called Recent Files since it may hold Visual
Studio or NUnit project names. The user may now set the number of items kept in the list.

<li>Loading of the most recently used file may be disabled by a command line switch.

<li>Nested Classes are now shown in the TreeView using the format OuterClass+InnerClass.
[Showing InnerClass under OuterClass was confusing when both classes contained tests.]

<li>The contents of the TreeView display are now sorted by name and tests execute in the order of
the display to allow easier tracking.

<li>Splitter positions are now saved in the registry and restored on startup.

<li>A View menu includes options for Expanding and Collapsing tree nodes, including Expand All,
Collapse All, Expand Fixtures and Collapse Fixtures.
</ul>

<h4>Console Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>The console interface command line parameters have been modified to support loading of
multiple assemblies, Visual Studio projects and NUnit projects. Several new switches are
available. See the Command Line Parameters section in this document for details.

<li>The console runner and tests now run in an STA.

<li>When run in debug mode, the console output is now sent to the Visual Studio Output window.

<li>Clicking on a test failure brings up the test file in the editor at location of the Assert.
Formatting of console output has been improved so that redirected output may be examined
conveniently in an editor that requires CRLF at the end of each line.

<li>All errors are now trapped and a message is displayed.
</ul>

<h4>Limitations</h4>
<ul>
<li>NUnit can only load assemblies as permitted under .NET's Code Access Security. Using the
default settings, this means that you will be unable to load from any UNC path, including one
that specifies the name of the local computer. Although you may use the .NET Framework
configuration utility to allow loading of such applications, you must do this with care. Often,
the simplest approach is to copy assemblies being tested to your local drive.
See Visual Studio Support for limitations on loading Visual Studio solution files.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.0 - October 3, 2002</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>Attribute based mechanism for identifying test fixtures and test methods. In previous versions of
NUnit and JUnit for that matter, inheritance was used as the mechanism for identifying which
classes were test fixtures and a naming convention was used to identify test methods in these
classes. The Custom Attributes available in .NET provide a much more straightforward and less
ambiguous mechanism for identification.

<li>Automatic creation of test suites. In previous versions of NUnit it was required to manually
construct suites of tests using a Suite property. This has been replaced with dynamic creation of
suites based on namespaces. Given an assembly the program will search through the assembly
looking for test fixtures. Once it finds one it creates a suite based for each namespace and the
specific test fixture. For example, NUnit.Tests.SuccessTests will build a containing Suite
called "NUnit" which will contain another suite called "Tests" which in turn will create another
suite called "SuccessTests" which finally will hold the individual test methods. This corrects an
error prone task where things may or may not have been included in a suite.

<li>Additional samples, Managed C++ and Visual J#. The existing samples (C#, VB.NET, Money)
have been upgraded to the new version. Money-port has been included to demonstrate the
minimal amount of effort required to upgrade.

<li>A class TestCase in nunit.framework.dll has been provided for backwards compatibility.
See the "Money-port" project as a sample of what is required to upgrade to the new version. The
only change is to update the reference to the new framework dll and provide a default constructor.

<li>The exception that is thrown when an Assertion fails is now called AssertionException. In
previous versions this was called AssertionFailedError.
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tree based display in forms interface with test status indication and the ability to run
individual tests or suites from the tree.

<li>Dynamic reloading of an assembly using AppDomains and shadow copying. This also
applies if you add or change tests. The assembly will be reloaded and the display will be
updated automatically. The shadow copies use we use a configurable directory specified 
in the executable's (nunit-gui and nunit-console) config files.

<li>A reload command menu option to load and assemblies that may have been modified.

<li>Window sizes are flexible due to the introduction of splitters on major sub-areas of the
screen.

<li>File->Recent Assemblies menu item. The program keeps track of the 5 most recently
used assemblies. If no command line arguments are used to start the forms executable
the most recent assembly is loaded by default.

<li>The "Run" button is the default button on the form, which allows hitting return to start
the tests.

<li>Patches suggested by Al Gonzalez
  <ul>
  <li>The AboutBox was modified so its start position is set to CenterParent
  <li>The AboutBox border was changed to Fixed3D
  <li>The size and position of the main form is saved in the registry and restored when the
program is launched
  </ul>
<li>Patch suggested by Rob Jeffries
  <ul>
  <li>When the main form has the focus hitting the space bar will cause the program to
exit. This is present in the current version of the VBunit.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Console Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>The console interface command line parameters have been modified to be more explicit and
conform to similar programs available in .NET. See the Command line parameters section
in this document for details.

<li>XML Output. The console program produces XML output suitable for inclusion into other
existing systems.

<li>Customizing of console output is provided through the use of XSLT. See Summary.xslt for
the translation that is provided for the release. Using your own transform file is possible via
a command line argument.

<li>Backwards compatibility with running suites. The Forms interface currently has no
mechanism to run suites defined with the suite property. Using the fixture command line
argument you must specify a class that is either a TestFixture or contains a Suite attribute.
</ul>
