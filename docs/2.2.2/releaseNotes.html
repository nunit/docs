<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<h3>NUnit Iteration Release 2.2.2 - December 7, 2004</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>With this version of NUnit, all references from the core to the framework 
assembly have been removed. It is now possible to run tests built against older 
versions of the framework, either debug or release build.</li>

<li>The Assert class now provides an AreNotEqual method which gives an error if 
the two arguments are equal.

<li>A StringAssert class has been added to the extensions assembly. It provides 
methods Contains, ContainsAny, StartsWith, EndsWith and AreEqualIgnoringCase.</li>

<li>The logic for each type of Assert is now been encapsulated in a class that 
implements the IAsserter interface. Asserter object instances are created for 
each individual assertion. This allows creating extended asserts by implementing 
new asserter classes. Several base classes are available for extension. The 
StringAssert class discussed above provides a model for making such extensions.

<li>A PlatformAttribute may be applied to test fixtures or tests, causing the 
tests to be run only on certain OS or runtime platforms. This is still experimental and may 
change - see the source for documentation.

<li>Applications built with Visual Studio 2005 may now be debugged using NUnit. 
NUnit itself may now be built and debugged under Visual Studio 2005.

<li>Trace output may be directed to standard output by setting TestContext.Tracing 
to true.

<li>Solution files containing web applications now be loaded without an exception. 
The web application is ignored.

<li>Solution files containing projects specified using UNC paths may now be loaded 
without an exception. As before, changes to security settings are required to enable
loading tests from shares.

<li>An error in one of the timing tests was corrected.

<li>The xml results file now uses the correct standard format for date and time 
independent of the system culture.

<li>Classes in the nunit.util assembly that were specific to either nunit-gui 
or nunit-console have been removed. As a result, nunit.util no longer refers to 
the Windows.Forms or System.Drawing assemblies. The classes are now in the 
nunit-gui-runner or nunit-console-runner assembly as appropriate.

<li>The NAnt build scripts in each subdirectory are now directly executable for 
convenience in working on a single component and for testing the scripts themselves.
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio projects and solutions may now be opened by dragging them to 
the tree control.

<li>The namespace hierarchy is no longer ignored, with only fixtures displayed, 
when nunit-gui was run with /fixture: plus a namespace argument.

<li>The TipWindow displayed over the errors and failures tab in the gui was 
throwing an exception under certain conditions. This is fixed and further 
usability improvements have been made.

<li>Further cases in which gui controls were being called on the wrong thread 
have been identified and corrected.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.2.1 Iteration Release - October 26, 2004</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>Reorganized source code into separate components, each with associated tests. 
An NUnit project file is now provided to facilitate running all the tests together.
Config files are provided for running the project and for each separate assembly.

<li>Both the gui and console runners are now dlls for those who want to link 
them with their own programs. New exe projects simply reference the dlls and 
work just as before.

<li>An experimental extensibility mechanism is now provided, which allows uses 
to create special types of test cases and suites, marked by their own attributes.

<li>The nunit.core.dll assembly is no longer registered in the GAC. An assembly 
resolution event handler is used to "inject" the current version of the core 
assembly into the user's appdomain. The nunit.framework.dll assembly continues 
to reside in the GAC for easier reference by user test assemblies.

<li>The NAnt build has been revised to work with the new directory structure. 
It is now possible to use NAnt to build individual components and assemblies, 
without building the entire application. To do this, simply run NAnt in the 
individual directory. Note that you must ensure that any referenced assemblies 
have been built first.

<li>Tests may now be run without the source code being present.

<li>NUnit can now open Visual Studio 2005 projects and solutions.

<li>Old style test cases ("Test....") are no longer recognized by default. 
A setting in the test config file may be used to allow their use on an 
assembly by assembly basis.

<li>Added a protected constructor to Assert so those wanting to inherit 
from it may do so. 

<li>Fixed a buffering problem that caused test case labels to appear out of 
synch with the test output. 

<li>Fixed a problem causing shadow copies to appear in the root of the current 
drive if no config file was present or if the setting was not provided in the 
config file. 
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>

<li>Code that fires events has been modified to ensure that controls are invoked 
on the correct thread. We believe this will solve many of the problems that occur 
when running tests under the VS 2005 debugger. However, we have not completed 
testing in this environment, so some problems may still be present.

<li>Fixed a problem causing the console output tab to contain old data if the 
tab had not been selected during the prior test run.

<li>Fixed a number of problems with the tipwindow used to display error details 
that don't fit in the normal display area.

<li>Fixed a problem whereby only the first of several selected tests run was 
expanded in the gui at completion of the run.
</ul>

<h4>Further Documentation</h4>
<ul>
<li>The included documentation has not changed substantially from NUnit 2.2. The following files in the doc directory provide additional information about changes in this iteration.
 <ul>
 <li>Installation.txt
 <li>TestConfig.txt
 <li>Extensibility.txt
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.2 - August 8, 2004</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>NUnit 2.2 is available in separate Microsoft .NET and Mono distributions. 
The .NET version can run under Microsoft .NET 1.0, 1.1 or 2.0. The Mono 
version runs under Mono 1.0. The Microsoft distribution is built using 
Visual Studio 2003. The Mono version is limited to use of nunit-console 
to run tests. Note that Mono is distributed with a version of NUnit 
pre-installed. It may be necessary replace some of the installed
components in order to get a newer version of NUnit to work. A note 
will be published when we have more information on this issue.

<li>Separate config files for each .NET version are no longer needed. Instead, 
binding redirects are provided in each config which apply when running under 
version 1.0 or 2.0 of hte .NET framework. By default, the highest level of
the framework installed is used. The user may edit the config file if a
different preference is desired.

<li>The NUnit framework and core are now in separate assemblies, both of
which are installed in the GAC. The framework assembly contains all 
types that are normally referenced by tests, while the core contains
those types used by the gui and console runners to execute those
tests. Tests requiring use of core types - TestSuite, for example -
will need to add a reference to the nunit.core.dll assembly.

<li>The NAnt build script now supports building NUnit using version 1.0, 1.1 
or 2.0 of the .NET framework or with Mono 1.0. The Mono build is limited
to those assemblies used under Mono.

<li>Assert.AreEqual has been extended to allow comparison of two arrays. 
To compare as equal, the arrays must be of the same or compatible types, 
contain the same number of elements and each pair of elements 
must compare as equal.

<li>All Assert methods that take an optional message argument now also may 
take an optional array of objects to be used in formatting the message.

<li>An Assert.Ignore method has been added, which allows individual test 
cases to be ignored dynamically - for example, on the basis of products 
installed on the test system. Assert.Ignore may also be called from a 
SetUp or TestFixtureSetUp method. In the latter case, all the tests are 
ignored.

<li>Failure in TestFixtureSetUp or TestFixtureCleanUp now results in an error, 
rather than in ignoring all the tests.

<li>The core interfaces used to run tests have been changed substantially. 
These will continue to change to some extent as we attempt to reach a 
stable set of interfaces for use by third-party clients that run tests 
through NUnit. In particular, the interfaces now support passing in an 
array of tests to be run and return an array of test results. Other 
new features described in this document have required interface 
changes as well.

<li>There is a new CategoryAttribute which allows test fixtures and methods 
to be grouped into one or more categories using strings as identifiers. 
Support is provided for running only those tests in selected categories
or all tests except those in selected categories.

<li>A new ExplicitAttribute designates a test case or fixture that should
only be run when explicitly chosen by the user - selected directly or
included by means of a Category selection. It will not be run merely
because its parent suite is selected.

<li>Tests may now be run using a filter. Currently, this support is used 
only by the new Category feature, but it is intended to be of general 
application for clients and - eventually - users.

<li>NUnit now recognizes when the loaded tests were built using an earlier 
version of the nunit framework and issues an appropriate message. 
Earlier versions simply failed to show any tests present in the assembly.

<li>NUnit now captures and issues a message when a worker thread, created 
during the running of a test, throws an exception. Previously, such 
exceptions were silently ignored.

<li>The XML output from a test run now shows the number of Asserts executed 
by each test. 

<li>When a test with ExpectedException fails because of an Assert, the 
message from the assert is now given priority over the message 
indicating that the wrong type of exception was thrown.

<li>Private SetUp and TearDown methods are now ignored as intended.

<li>SetUp and TearDown are no longer executed for ignored tests.

<li>The documentation is now provided as a set of HTML files.
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tree of tests now optionally displays checkboxes. These may be used 
to select multiple tests to be run. Buttons allow clearing all checkboxes 
and checking only failing tests.

<li>There is now an option to display the name of each test in the standard output.

<li>The thread used to run tests is now created in the test AppDomain. The 
priority and apartment state for this thread may now be specified in 
the config file for the test. A separate configuration section is now
used for NUnit settings, to avoid name collision with settings required 
by the application under test.

<li>Command-line options are provided to allow the gui to load and begin 
running a test suite and to load a specific fixture from an assembly.
The properties dialog now shows the number of asserts executed for 
each test and any description associated with a test.

<li>A cancel button has been added to the project save dialog that appears 
on shutdown.

<li>The display of the last exception is now scrollable, allowing the 
entire stack to be seen.
</ul>

<h4>Console Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>The console program has been reorganized to remove differences in how 
tests are run between the console and gui runners.

<li>The console interface command line parameters now include provision for
selecting or excluding tests based on category, for displaying the name
of each test in the standard output and for redirecting standard or
error output from tests to a file. 

<li>The /noshadow option eliminates creation of a shadow copy and the /thread 
option causes the console tests to be run on a separate thread. When a 
separate thread is used, the config file settings for apartment state 
will be honored.

<li>A namespace may now be specified after /fixture and all tests in that 
namespace will be executed.
</ul>

<h4>Mock Objects</h4>
<ul>
<li>This version of NUnit comes with a built-in, lightweight mock object 
facility. The functions provided include dynamic creation of an 
implementation of any interface or MBR class, setting of expectations, 
specification of return values and verification that the expected 
actions occurred.

<li>This facility is in no way a replacement for full-fledged mock 
frameworks such as NMock and is not expected to add significant 
features in upcoming releases. Its primary purpose is to support 
NUnit's own tests. We wanted to do that without the need to choose a
particular mock framework and without having to deal with versioning 
issues outside of NUnit itself.

<li>At the same time, we hope that easy availability of a minimal mock 
object facility will inspire users who are not familiar with mock 
objects to experiment with them using our built-in facility and to 
migrate to a more complete framework as your needs call for it.
</ul>

<h4>Limitations</h4>

<ul>
<li>The CategoryAttribute was originally designed to have an Explicit 
property. This was included in some early releases and is described in
the Pragmatic Programmers' recent book. This property has been removed
and is replaced by the ExplicitAttribute, which can be used in
conjunction with Category to achieve the same effect as shown in
their examples.
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.1 - September 1, 2003</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>The distributed version of NUnit 2.1 is now built using Visual Studio 2003 The solution and
project files in this Beta can only be loaded by Visual Studio 2003. Those needing to build
with Visual Studio 2002 will need to convert the project, solution and resx files.
NUnit can run against .NET framework versions 1.0 or 1.1. Separate config files are provided for
using either version. The install detects the highest version installed and sets up the config for
that version.

<li>NUnit now supports loading and running tests across multiple assemblies in both the console and
the GUI. This may be done on an adhoc basis or by creating NUnit test projects saved in files
of type NUnit.

<li>Information about one or more test assemblies may now be persisted as NUnit Test Projects.
This is a file of type .nunit in XML format which supports the definition of multiple
configurations each containing one or more assemblies.

<li>TestFixtureSetUp and TestFixtureTearDown attributes are now recognized. Methods marked
with these attributes will be run before and after the tests in a fixture. Unlike the standard
SetUp and TearDown attributes, these methods are invoked only once, before and after all the
tests are run.

<li>The Assertion class is now deprecated and has been replaced with the Assert class supporting
a new set of static method names.

<li>The reporting of test failures and errors provides more information. The specific type of an
exception is reported as well as any inner exceptions. Exceptions in TearDown no longer hide
the original test exception.

<li>NUnit now runs under Windows 98 and ME. Automatic reload of changed assemblies is
disabled in non-NT environments.
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>There are a number of additional menu items. [Specify]

<li>The GUI interface now runs tests on a separate thread. This allows the tree display to update as
execution proceeds. A Stop button now allows cancelling a test run. An option to cancel the
run is also displayed if the user attempts to exit while a test is running.
The GUI test threads run in the MTA by default. A configuration file setting may be used to run
them in an STA.

<li>XML output from a test run may now be saved using the Tools | Save Results as XML... menu
item. The format is the same as that used by the Console runner.

<li>When an exception occurs while trying to load, unload or run a test, the complete stack trace for
that exception is available through the Tools | Exception Details... menu item.

<li>The Tools | Options... menu item allows setting a number of options. [Specify]

<li>Automatic reloading of test assemblies may now be disabled. An alternate approach of reloading
assemblies whenever a run begins is also available as an option.

<li>If Visual Studio support is enabled, Visual Studio project and solution files may be opened and
Visual Studio projects may be added to an NUnit test project. Currently, C#, VB.NET, J# and
managed C++ projects are supported.

<li>When a Visual Studio or NUnit project is loaded, the user may switch between the available
configurations causing the tests to be reloaded. A Configuration Editor allows adding,
deleting or renaming configurations.

<li>The GUI allows creating and modifying NUnit Test Projects through the Project Editor.
A Properties window is now availble to display information about any test in the tree. It may be
pinned to allow quickly examining the results of different tests.

<li>Window layout has been streamlined, eliminating one splitter and reducing the area above the
tabs to the minimum size needed.

<li>The File | Recent Assemblies menu item is now called Recent Files since it may hold Visual
Studio or NUnit project names. The user may now set the number of items kept in the list.

<li>Loading of the most recently used file may be disabled by a command line switch.

<li>Nested Classes are now shown in the TreeView using the format OuterClass+InnerClass.
[Showing InnerClass under OuterClass was confusing when both classes contained tests.]

<li>The contents of the TreeView display are now sorted by name and tests execute in the order of
the display to allow easier tracking.

<li>Splitter positions are now saved in the registry and restored on startup.

<li>A View menu includes options for Expanding and Collapsing tree nodes, including Expand All,
Collapse All, Expand Fixtures and Collapse Fixtures.
</ul>

<h4>Console Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>The console interface command line parameters have been modified to support loading of
multiple assemblies, Visual Studio projects and NUnit projects. Several new switches are
available. See the Command Line Parameters section in this document for details.

<li>The console runner and tests now run in an STA.

<li>When run in debug mode, the console output is now sent to the Visual Studio Output window.

<li>Clicking on a test failure brings up the test file in the editor at location of the Assert.
Formatting of console output has been improved so that redirected output may be examined
conveniently in an editor that requires CRLF at the end of each line.

<li>All errors are now trapped and a message is displayed.
</ul>

<h4>Limitations</h4>
<ul>
<li>NUnit can only load assemblies as permitted under .NET's Code Access Security. Using the
default settings, this means that you will be unable to load from any UNC path, including one
that specifies the name of the local computer. Although you may use the .NET Framework
configuration utility to allow loading of such applications, you must do this with care. Often,
the simplest approach is to copy assemblies being tested to your local drive.
See Visual Studio Support for limitations on loading Visual Studio solution files.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>NUnit 2.0 - October 3, 2002</h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>Attribute based mechanism for identifying test fixtures and test methods. In previous versions of
NUnit and JUnit for that matter, inheritance was used as the mechanism for identifying which
classes were test fixtures and a naming convention was used to identify test methods in these
classes. The Custom Attributes available in .NET provide a much more straightforward and less
ambiguous mechanism for identification.

<li>Automatic creation of test suites. In previous versions of NUnit it was required to manually
construct suites of tests using a Suite property. This has been replaced with dynamic creation of
suites based on namespaces. Given an assembly the program will search through the assembly
looking for test fixtures. Once it finds one it creates a suite based for each namespace and the
specific test fixture. For example, NUnit.Tests.SuccessTests will build a containing Suite
called "NUnit" which will contain another suite called "Tests" which in turn will create another
suite called "SuccessTests" which finally will hold the individual test methods. This corrects an
error prone task where things may or may not have been included in a suite.

<li>Additional samples, Managed C++ and Visual J#. The existing samples (C#, VB.NET, Money)
have been upgraded to the new version. Money-port has been included to demonstrate the
minimal amount of effort required to upgrade.

<li>A class TestCase in nunit.framework.dll has been provided for backwards compatibility.
See the "Money-port" project as a sample of what is required to upgrade to the new version. The
only change is to update the reference to the new framework dll and provide a default constructor.

<li>The exception that is thrown when an Assertion fails is now called AssertionException. In
previous versions this was called AssertionFailedError.
</ul>

<h4>Forms Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tree based display in forms interface with test status indication and the ability to run
individual tests or suites from the tree.

<li>Dynamic reloading of an assembly using AppDomains and shadow copying. This also
applies if you add or change tests. The assembly will be reloaded and the display will be
updated automatically. The shadow copies use we use a configurable directory specified 
in the executable's (nunit-gui and nunit-console) config files.

<li>A reload command menu option to load and assemblies that may have been modified.

<li>Window sizes are flexible due to the introduction of splitters on major sub-areas of the
screen.

<li>File->Recent Assemblies menu item. The program keeps track of the 5 most recently
used assemblies. If no command line arguments are used to start the forms executable
the most recent assembly is loaded by default.

<li>The "Run" button is the default button on the form, which allows hitting return to start
the tests.

<li>Patches suggested by Al Gonzalez
  <ul>
  <li>The AboutBox was modified so its start position is set to CenterParent
  <li>The AboutBox border was changed to Fixed3D
  <li>The size and position of the main form is saved in the registry and restored when the
program is launched
  </ul>
<li>Patch suggested by Rob Jeffries
  <ul>
  <li>When the main form has the focus hitting the space bar will cause the program to
exit. This is present in the current version of the VBunit.
  </ul>
</ul>

<h4>Console Interface</h4>
<ul>
<li>The console interface command line parameters have been modified to be more explicit and
conform to similar programs available in .NET. See the Command line parameters section
in this document for details.

<li>XML Output. The console program produces XML output suitable for inclusion into other
existing systems.

<li>Customizing of console output is provided through the use of XSLT. See Summary.xslt for
the translation that is provided for the release. Using your own transform file is possible via
a command line argument.

<li>Backwards compatibility with running suites. The Forms interface currently has no
mechanism to run suites defined with the suite property. Using the fixture command line
argument you must specify a class that is either a TestFixture or contains a Suite attribute.
</ul>
