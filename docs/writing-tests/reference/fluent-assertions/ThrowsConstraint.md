# Throws Constraint

`ThrowsConstraint` is used to test that some code, represented as a delegate,
throws a particular exception. It may be used alone, to merely test the type
of constraint, or with an additional constraint to be applied to the exception
specified as an argument.

The related [ThrowsNothingConstraint](ThrowsNothingConstraint.md) simply asserts that the delegate
does not throw an exception.

## Constructors

```csharp
ThrowsConstraint(Type expectedType)
ThrowsConstraint<T>()
ThrowsConstraint(Type expectedType, Constraint constraint)
ThrowsConstraint<T>(Constraint constraint)
```

## Syntax

```csharp
Throws.Exception
Throws.TargetInvocationException
Throws.ArgumentException
Throws.ArgumentNullException
Throws.InvalidOperationException
Throws.TypeOf(Type expectedType)
Throws.TypeOf<T>()
Throws.InstanceOf(Type expectedType)
Throws.InstanceOf<T>()
Throws.InnerException
```

## Examples of Use

```csharp
Assert.That(SomeMethod, Throws.TypeOf<ArgumentException>());
Assert.That(SomeMethod, Throws.Exception.TypeOf<ArgumentException>());
Assert.That(SomeMethod, Throws.TypeOf<ArgumentException>()
                    .With.Property("Parameter").EqualTo("myParam"));
Assert.That(SomeMethod, Throws.ArgumentException);
Assert.That(SomeMethod, Throws.TargetInvocationException
                    .With.InnerException.TypeOf<ArgumentException>());
Assert.That(() => { throw new ArgumentException(); }, Throws.ArgumentException);
```

## Notes

1. **Throws.Exception** may be followed by further constraints,
    which are applied to the exception itself as shown in the last two
    examples above. It may also be used alone to verify that some
    exception has been thrown, without regard to type. This is
    not a recommended practice since you should normally know
    what exception you are expecting.

2. **Throws.TypeOf** and **Throws.InstanceOf** are provided
    as a shorter syntax for this common test. They work exactly like
    the corresponding forms following **Throws.Exception**.

3. **Throws.TargetInvocationException**, **Throws.ArgumentException**
    and **Throws.InvalidOperationException** provide a shortened form
    for some common exceptions.

4. Used alone, **Throws.InnerException** simply tests the InnerException
    value of the thrown exception. More commonly, it will be used in
    combination with a test for the type of the outer exception as shown
    in the examples above.
