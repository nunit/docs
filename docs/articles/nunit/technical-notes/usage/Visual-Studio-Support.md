# Visual Studio Support

NUnit supports the Visual Studio project and solution format, which are also used by a number of other IDEs.

## Running From Within Visual Studio

The most convenient way to do this is to set up a custom tool entry specifying the path to NUnit as the command. For a
VS2003 C# project, you can use $(TargetPath) for the arguments and $(TargetDir) for the initial directory.

With Visual Studio VS2005 this becomes a bit harder, because that release changed the meaning of the 'Target' macros so
they now point to the intermediate 'obj' directories rather than the final output in one of the 'bin' directories. Here
are some alternatives that work in both versions:

* **$(ProjectDir)$(ProjectFileName)** to open the VS Project rather than the assembly. If you use this approach, be sure
    to rename your config file accordingly and put it in the same directory as the VS project file.
* **$(ProjectDir)bin/Debug/$(TargetName)$(TargetExt)** to run the assembly directly. Note that this requires hard-coding
    part of the path, including the configuration.

If you would like to debug your tests, use the Visual Studio Debug | Processesâ€¦ menu item to attach to NUnit after
starting it and set breakpoints in your test code as desired before running the tests.

## Opening Visual Studio Projects

When Visual Studio support is enabled, the File Open dialog displays the following supported Visual Studio project
types: C#, VB.Net, J# and C++. The project file is read and the configurations and output assembly locations are
identified. Since the project files do not contain information about the most recently opened configuration, the output
assembly for the first configuration found (usually Debug) is loaded in the GUI. The tree shows the project as the
top-level node with the assembly shown as its descendant.

When tests are run for a Visual studio project, they run just as if the output assembly had been loaded with one
exception. The default location for the config file is the directory containing the project file and its default name is
the same as the project file with an extension of .config. For example, the following command would load the tests in
the nunit.tests assembly using the configuration file nunit.tests.dll.config located in the same directory as the dll.

```cmd
nunit.exe nunit.tests.dll
```

On the other hand, the following command would load the tests using the configuration file nunit.tests.config located in
the same directory as the csproj file.

```cmd
nunit.exe nunit.tests.csproj
```

The same consideration applies to running tests using the console runner.

## Opening Visual Studio Solutions

When Visual Studio support is enabled, solution files may be opened as well. All the output assemblies from contained
projects of the types supported will be loaded in the tree. In the case where all contained projects are located in the
subdirectories beneath the solution, it will be possible to load and run tests using this method directly.

When a solution contains projects located elsewhere in the file system, it may not be possible to run the tests -
although the solution will generally load without problem. In this case, the Project Editor should be use to modify and
save the NUnit test project so that there is all referenced assemblies are located in or beneath the application base
directory.
