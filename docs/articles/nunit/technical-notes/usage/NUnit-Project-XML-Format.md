# NUnit Project XML Format

## `<NUnitProject>`

The required root element for any NUnit project file.

* **Containing Element:** None
* **Contained Elements:** [`<Settings>`](#settings), [`<Config>`](#config)
* **Attributes:**   None

## `<Settings>`

Contains global settings that apply to all configurations in the project. May be empty or absent.

* **Containing Element:** [`<NUnitProject>`](#nunitproject)
* **Contained Elements:** None
* **Attributes:**
  * `activeconfig` The name of the config to use if none is specified by the user. Using `nunit-console`, you may
    override this through the `--config` command-line option.
  * `appbase` The application base to use in loading and running tests. Defaults to the location of the .nunit project
    file. If the path is relative, as it normally is, it is taken as relative to the location of the project file.
  * `processModel` Specifies how NUnit should create processes for executing test assemblies. Possible values are:
    Default, Single (no separate processes are created), Separate (tests are run in a single, separate process) and
    Multiple (each assembly is run in its own separate process). The default value is Multiple, provided there are
    multiple assemblies, otherwise Separate.
  * `domainUsage` Specifies how NUnit should create AppDomains within each process for running tests. Possible values
    are: Default, None (no domain is created), Single (a single domain is created) and Multiple (a separate domain is
    created for each assembly). The default is Multiple if multiple assemblies are run in the same process, Single if
    only one assembly is run in a process.

## `<Config>`

Describes a specific configuration of the project. This may map to traditional compiler configs like `Debug` or
`Release` or may be used to specify any arbitrary collection of assemblies to be tested together. At least one
configuration should be specified or the project will not be usable.

* **Containing Element:** [`<NUnitProject>`](#nunitproject)
* **Contained Elements:** [`<assembly>`](#assembly)
* **Attributes:**
  * `name` The name of this configuration. (Required)
  * `appbase` The application base to use in loading and running tests under this config. Defaults to the appbase
    specified in the `<Settings>` element. The path should normally be relative to that global application base or to
    the location of project file if there is no global appbase.
  * `binpath` The probing path used to search for assemblies, consisting of a number of directory paths separated by
    semicolons. The directory paths should be relative to the application base and must be under it. Specifying this
    attribute automatically sets the `binpathtype` to 'manual'.
  * `binpathtype` Indicates how the probing path is determined. Possible values are: Auto (the probing path is
    determined from the location of the test assemblies), Manual (the path is specified by the binpath attribute) and
    None (no probing path is used). It is an error to specify a value other than Manual if the `binpath` attribute is
    also used.
  * `configfile` Specifies the path to a config file to be used when running tests under this configuration. The path is
    relative to the application base.
  * `processModel` Specifies how NUnit should create processes for executing test assemblies under this configuration.
    Possible values are: Default, Single (no separate processes are created), Separate (tests are run in a single,
    separate process) and Multiple (each assembly is run in its own separate process). The default is the value
    specified globally or Multiple if nothing has been specified.
  * `domainUsage` Specifies how NUnit should create AppDomains within each process for running tests under this
    configuration. Possible values are: Default, None (no domain is created), Single (a single domain is created) and
    Multiple (a separate domain is created for each assembly). The default is the value specified globally, if provided,
    otherwise Multiple if multiple assemblies are run in the same process, Single if only one assembly is run in a
    process.
  * `runtimeFramework` Specifies a runtime framework to be used in running tests. Abbreviations are the same as those
    accepted by the nunit-console command-line. If none is specified, tests are run under the target runtime specified
    when the assembly was compiled.

## `<assembly>`

Specifies a single assembly containing tests.

* **Containing Element:** [`<Config>`](#config)
* **Contained Elements:** None
* **Attributes:**
  * **path** The path to the test assembly, relative to the application base for its configuration.
