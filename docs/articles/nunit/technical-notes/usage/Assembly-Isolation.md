# Assembly Isolation

NUnit isolates test assemblies from its own code and from one another
by use of separate Processes and AppDomains.

By default, NUnit loads each test assembly into a separate **Process**
under the control of the NUnit Agent
program. This allows NUnit to ensure that each assembly is loaded in the environment
for which it was built. Within the agent process, NUnit's own code runs in the primary
**AppDomain** while the tests run in a separate **AppDomain**.

If desired, multiple test assemblies may be loaded into the same process and
even the same domain by use of the **-process** and **-domain** command-line
options. See [Console Command Line](xref:consolecommandline).
