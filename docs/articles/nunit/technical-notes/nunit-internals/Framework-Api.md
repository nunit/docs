# Framework API

The NUnit 3 Framework API consists of a number of related classes with well-known names contained in the framework. The
NUnit 3 Framework Driver, which is part of the engine, performs actions by creating these classes. All required actions
are performed in the constructor. The driver only needs to know the names of the classes and the arguments each one
accepts.

This document describes the interface between the driver and framework and the rules that must be followed to provide
continued backward compatibility as new versions of the framework are created. Note that it __only__ applies to the
NUnit 3 framework.

The following is a simplified example of how a calling program might use the framework to load and run tests in a
particular `AppDomain`. This sort of code is expected to reside only in a driver. User-created runners should use the
Engine API rather than dealing with the framework at this low level. See below for explanations of each call.

```csharp
var myHandler = new MyHandlerClass(); // implements ICallbackEventHandler

// Create the controller
var args = new object[] { "my.test.assembly.dll", new Hashtable()};
var controller = domain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(
    "nunit.framework", "NUnit.Framework.Api.FrameworkController",
    false, 0, null, args, null, null, null);

// Load the assembly
args = new object[] { controller, myHandler };
domain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(
    "nunit.framework", "NUnit.Framework.Api.FrameworkController+LoadTestsAction",
    false, 0, null, args, null, null, null);

// myHandler.GetCallbackResult() should return an Xml string with the result
// of the Load, which was passed to it by the framework.
// We're not checking this here, as we normally would do.

// Run the tests
args = new object[] { controller, "<filter/>", myHandler };
domain.CreateInstanceAndUnwrap(
    "nunit.framework", "NUnit.Framework.Api.FrameworkController+RunTestsAction",
    false, 0, null, args, null, null, null);

// myHandler.GetCallbackResult() should return an Xml string with the results
// of running the test, which was passed to it by the framework.
```

## API Classes

The following classes provide the API:

* FrameworkPackageSettings
* FrameworkController
* FrameworkControllerAction
  * LoadTestsAction
  * CountTestsAction
  * ExploreTestsAction
  * RunTestsAction

### FrameworkPackageSettings

This static class defines constants for the names of all settings recognized by the framework. We use
`FrameworkPackageSettings` rather than constants spread throughout the code in order to keep things consistent. A copy
of this class is maintained in both the console runner and the framework and the settings are passed through to the
framework by the engine.

As new versions of the framework are released, settings in this file are not changed, although new settings may be
added. See the code itself for a list of the settings in use.

### FrameworkController

The driver creates a `FrameworkController` instance using reflection for each test assembly that must be loaded for
browsing or execution. The constructor is defined as follows:

```csharp
public FrameworkController(string assemblyPath, string idPrefix, IDictionary settings)
```

where

* `assemblyPath` is the full path to the test assembly.
* `idPrefix` is a prefix used for all test ids created under this controller. This is how the engine is able to provide
  unique ids for each test identified, even though multiple assemblies, frameworks and controllers may be involved.
* `settings` is an IDictionary containing the settings to be used in loading and running this assembly. A non-generic
  dictionary is used to allow for implementation of the framework on platforms that don't support Generics.

This constructor always succeeds, provided that the arguments are of the correct types. Any operational errors will
occur when specific actions like Load or Run are taken.

### FrameworkControllerAction

As the driver needs to perform some action, it creates a temporary instance of a class derived from
`FrameworkControllerAction`. The constructors for all actions have the following points in common:

* They take an instance of `FrameworkController` as their first argument. This must be the instance originally created
  by the driver for the particular assembly. This instance provides a common point of communication among various
  actions taken against the assembly.
* Another argument, the last one, is an object that implements `System.Web.UI.ICallbackEventHandler`. The handler
  receives the result of each action and - in the case of executing tests - progress notifications.
* Due to the nature of the `ICallbackEventHandler` interface, the results returned are always strings. The specific
  content of each result depends on the particular action.
* Exceptions are only thrown in the case of completely unanticipated errors, generally meaning an error in the calling
  program or a bug in the framework. We don't consider things like missing or bad files or exceptions thrown in user
  code as unanticipated.

Some actions take the string representation of a test filter as an argument. The NUnit Engine and Framework have shared
knowledge of the format of a filter. For an empty filter (no filtering) use `"<filter/>"`. A null or empty string is
also accepted for an empty filter as of NUnit 3.7.1, but `"<filter/>"` should be used for backwards compatibility.

> [!NOTE]
> The `ICallbackEventHandler` is actually passed as an object and cast to the interface by the framework. This
> is intended to allow future use of other interfaces for progress.

### LoadTestsAction

`LoadTestsAction` must be used before any other action can be called. Its constructor is as follows:

```csharp
public LoadTestsAction(FrameworkController controller, object handler);
```

where

* `controller` is the FrameworkController instance that was created for managing the test assembly.
* `handler` is an object implementing `ICallbackEventHandler`, to receive the result of the load.

The result returned from `handler.GetCallbackResult()` is the XML representation of the loaded test assembly. No child
tests are included in the XML, since this method will be called by programs with no need for such a level of detail.
Programs requiring the full tree of tests, such as Gui runners, should follow up by using the `ExploreTestsAction`.

If the assembly can not be found or loaded, the same result is returned, but with a `RunState` of `NotRunnable`.

### ExploreTestsAction

`ExploreTestsAction` is used to get the full tree of tests, as for display in a Gui. Its constructor is as follows:

```csharp
public ExploreTestsAction(FrameworkController controller, string filter, object handler);
```

where

* __controller__ is the FrameworkController instance that was created for managing the test assembly.
* __filter__ is the string representation of a filter in XML format to be used when exploring tests.
* __handler__ is an object implementing ICallbackEventHandler, to receive the result of the call.

The result returned from `handler.GetCallbackResult()` is the XML representation of the test assembly, containing all
tests that passed the filter, arranged as a tree with child tests contained within their parents.

If the assembly was not found or unable to be loaded, a non-runnable assembly with no child tests is returned.

If this action is invoked without first invoking `LoadTestsAction`, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown.

### CountTestsAction

CountTestsAction is used to get the number of test cases that will be executed under a specified filter, for use in a
progress display. Its constructor is as follows.

```csharp
public CountTestsAction(FrameworkController controller, string filter, object handler);
```

where

* `controller` is the `FrameworkController` instance that was created for managing the test assembly.
* `filter` is the string representation of a filter in XML format to be used when counting tests.
* `handler` is an object implementing `ICallbackEventHandler`, to receive the result of the call.

The result returned from `handler.GetCallbackResult()` is the string representation of the integer number of test cases
that match the filter.

If the assembly was not found or unable to be loaded, "0" is returned.

If this action is invoked without first invoking `LoadTestsAction`, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown.

### RunTestsAction

`RunTestsAction` is used to execute the loaded tests. Its constructor is as follows:

```csharp
public RunTestsAction(FrameworkController controller, string filter, object handler);
```

where

* `controller` is the `FrameworkController` instance that was created for managing the test assembly.
* `filter` is the string representation of a filter in XML format to be used when counting tests.
* `handler` is an object implementing `ICallbackEventHandler`, to receive the result of the call.

The result returned from `handler.GetCallbackResult` is the XML representation of the test result, including all child
results.

If the assembly was not found or could not be loaded, a non-runnable result with no child tests is returned.

If this action is invoked without first invoking `LoadTestsAction`, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown.

### RunAsyncAction

`RunAsyncAction` is used to initiate an asynchronous test run, returning immediately. Its constructor is as follows:

```csharp
public RunAsyncAction(FrameworkController controller, string filter, object handler);
```

where

* `controller` is the `FrameworkController` instance that was created for managing the test assembly.
* `filter` is the string representation of a filter in XML format to be used when counting tests.
* `handler` is an object implementing `ICallbackEventHandler`, to receive the result of the call.

No actual result is returned immediately from the call. The `handler` progress notices must be tracked in order to know
what is going on with the tests and eventually the final result may be retrieved.

If the assembly was not found or could not be loaded, a non-runnable result with no child tests is returned.

If this action is invoked without first invoking `LoadTestsAction`, an `InvalidOperationException` is thrown.

### StopRunAction

`StopRunAction` is used to stop an ongoing test run. Its constructor is as follows:

```csharp
public StopRunAction(FrameworkController controller, bool force, object handler);
```

where

* `controller` is the `FrameworkController` instance that was created for managing the test assembly.
* `force` indicates whether or not the stop should be forced, as opposed to a cooperative stop.
* `handler` is an object implementing `ICallbackEventHandler`, to receive the result of the call.

No result is returned from the call. If no run is in progress, the call is ignored.
