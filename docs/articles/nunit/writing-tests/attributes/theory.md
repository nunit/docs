# Theory

A Theory is a special type of test, used to verify a general statement about the system under development. Normal tests
are _example-based_. That is, the developer supplies one or more examples of inputs and expected outputs either within
the code of the test or - in the case of [Parameterized Tests](xref:parameterizedtests) - as arguments to the test
method. A theory, on the other hand, makes a general statement that all of its assertions will pass for all arguments
satisfying certain assumptions.

Theories are implemented in NUnit as non-generic methods within a **TestFixture**, which are annotated with the
**TheoryAttribute**. Theory methods must always have arguments and therefore appears quite similar to [Parameterized
Tests](xref:parameterizedtests) at first glance. However, a Theory incorporates additional data sources for its
arguments and allows special processing for assumptions about that data. The key difference, though, is that theories
make general statements and are more than just a set of examples.

## Data for Theories

The primary source of data for a **Theory** is the [Datapoint Attribute](datapoint.md) or [DatapointSource
Attribute](datapointsource.md). NUnit will use any class members of the required types, which are annotated with one of
these attributes, to provide data for each parameter of the Theory. NUnit assembles the values for individual arguments
combinatorially to provide test cases for the theory.

In addition to the Datapoint and Datapoints attributes, it is possible to use any of the approaches for supplying data
that are recognized on normal parameterized tests. We suggest that this capability not be overused, since it runs
counter to the distinction between a test based on examples and a theory. However, it may be useful in order to
guarantee that a specific test case is included.

For **boolean** and **enum** arguments, NUnit can supply the data without any action by the user. All possible values
are supplied to the argument. This feature is disabled if the user supplies any values for the argument.

> [!NOTE]
> Because NUnit searches for datapoints based on the type of the argument, generic methods may not currently be
> used as theories. This limitation may be removed in a future release. See below for a workaround using a generic
> fixture.

## Assumptions

The theory itself is responsible for ensuring that all data supplied meets its assumptions. It does this by use of the
**Assume.That(...)** construct, which works just like **Assert.That(...)** but does not cause a failure. If the
assumption is not satisfied for a particular test case, that case returns an Inconclusive result, rather than a Success
or Failure.

The overall result of executing a Theory over a set of test cases is determined as follows:

* If the assumptions are violated for **all** test cases, then the Theory itself is marked as a failure.
* If any Assertion fails, the Theory itself fails.
* If at least **some** cases pass the stated assumptions, and there are **no** assertion failures or exceptions, then
  the Theory passes.

Since the user does not generally care about inconclusive cases under a theory, they are not normally displayed in the
Gui. For situations where they are needed - such as debugging - the context menu for the theory provides an option to
display them.

## Example

In the following example, the Theory SquareRootDefinition verifies that the implementation of square root satisfies the
following definition:

> Given a non-negative number, the square root of that number is always non-negative and, when multiplied by itself,
> gives the original number.

```csharp
public class SqrtTests
{
    [DatapointSource]
    public double[] values = new double[] { 0.0, 1.0, -1.0, 42.0 };

    [Theory]
    public void SquareRootDefinition(double num)
    {
        Assume.That(num >= 0.0);

        double sqrt = Math.Sqrt(num);

        Assert.That(sqrt >= 0.0);
        Assert.That(sqrt * sqrt, Is.EqualTo(num).Within(0.000001));
    }
}
```

## Theories in Generic Fixtures

In a generic fixture with Type parameter `T` individual methods using `T` as a parameter type are not generic, since `T`
has been resolved to an actual Type in instantiating the fixture instance. You may use such methods as theories and any
data of the appropriate type will be used.

```csharp
[TestFixture(typeof(int))]
[TestFixture(typeof(double))]
public class TheorySampleTestsGeneric<T>
{
    [Datapoint]
    public double[] ArrayDouble1 = { 1.2, 3.4 };
    [Datapoint]
    public double[] ArrayDouble2 = { 5.6, 7.8 };
    [Datapoint]
    public int[] ArrayInt = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };

    [Theory]
    public void TestGenericForArbitraryArray(T[] array)
    {
        Assert.That(array.Length, Is.EqualTo(4));
    }
}
```
