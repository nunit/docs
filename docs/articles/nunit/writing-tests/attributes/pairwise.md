# Pairwise

The **PairwiseAttribute** is used on a test to specify that NUnit should
generate test cases in such a way that all possible pairs of
values are used. This is a well-known approach for combatting
the combinatorial explosion of test cases when more than
two features (parameters) are involved.

## Example

Using the Combinatorial attribute, the following test would be executed 12 (3x2x2) times.
With **Pairwise** it is executed only enough times so that each possible pair is covered..

```csharp
[Test, Pairwise]
public void MyTest(
    [Values("a", "b", "c")] string a,
    [Values("+", "-")] string b,
    [Values("x", "y")] string c)
{
    Console.WriteLine("{0} {1} {2}", a, b, c);
}
```

For this test, NUnit currently calls the method six times, producing the following output:

```none
a - x
a + y
b - y
b + x
c - x
c + y
```

Note that this is not the optimal output. The pairs (-, x) and (+, y)
appear twice. NUnit uses a heuristic algorithm to reduce the number of test cases as much
as it can. Improvements may be made in the future.

## Limitations

When used on a generic method the programmer must ensure that all
possible combinations of arguments are valid. When multiple parameters
use the same generic type (e.g.: T) this may not be possible and the
attribute may generate invalid test cases.
