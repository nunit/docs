# Test

The `Test` attribute is one way of marking a method inside a TestFixture class as a test. It is normally used for simple
(non-parameterized) tests but may also be applied to parameterized tests without causing any extra test cases to be
generated. See [Parameterized Tests](xref:parameterizedtests) for more info.

The test method may be either an instance or a static method.

Test methods targeting .Net 4.0 or higher may be marked as **async** and NUnit will wait for the method to complete
before recording the result and moving on to the next test. Async test methods must return `Task` if no value is
returned, or `Task<T>` if a value of type T is returned.

If the programmer marks a test method that does not have the correct signature it will be considered as not runnable.
  
If the test method returns a value, you must pass in the `ExpectedResult` named parameter to the Test attribute. This
expected return value will be checked for equality with the return value of the test method.

The test `Description` may be specified as a named parameter. This is exactly equivalent to using the
`DescriptionAttribute` on the test.

## Examples

```csharp
namespace NUnit.Tests
{
  using System;
  using NUnit.Framework;

  [TestFixture]
  public class SuccessTests
  {
    // A simple test
    [Test]
    public void Add()
    { /* ... */ }

    // A test with a description property
    [Test(Description="My really cool test")]
    public void Add()
    { /* ... */ }

    // Alternate way to specify description as a separate attribute
    [Test, Description("My really really cool test")]
    public void Add()
    { /* ... */ }

    // A simple async test
    [Test]
    public async Task AddAsync()
    { /* ... */ }

    // Test with an expected result
    [Test(ExpectedResult = 4)]
    public int TestAdd()
    {
        return 2 + 2;
    }

    // Async test with an expected result
    [Test(ExpectedResult = 4)]
    public async Task<int> TestAdd()
    {
        await ...
        return 2 + 2;
    }
  }
}
```
