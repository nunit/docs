# LevelOfParallelism

This is an _assembly-level_ attribute, which may be used to specify the level of parallelism, that is, the maximum
number of worker threads executing tests in the assembly. It may be overridden using a command-line option in the
console runner.

This attribute is optional. If it is not specified, NUnit uses the processor count or 2, whichever is greater. For
example, on a four processor machine the default value is 4.

## Example

The following code, which might be placed in AssemblyInfo.cs, sets the level of parallelism to 3:

```csharp
[assembly:LevelOfParallelism(3)]
```

## Platform Support

Parallel execution is supported by the NUnit framework on desktop .NET runtimes. It is not supported in our Portable or
.NET Standard builds at this time, although the attributes are recognized without error in order to allow use in
projects that build against multiple targets.
