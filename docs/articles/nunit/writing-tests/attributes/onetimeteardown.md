# OneTimeTearDown

This attribute is to identify methods that are called once after executing all the tests
in a fixture. It may appear on methods of a TestFixture or a SetUpFixture.

OneTimeTearDown methods may be either static or
instance methods and you may define more than one of them in a fixture.
Normally, multiple OneTimeTearDown methods are only defined at different levels
of an inheritance hierarchy, as explained below.

So long as any OneTimeSetUp method runs without error, the OneTimeTearDown method is
guaranteed to run. It will not run if a OneTimeSetUp method fails or throws an
exception.

## Example

```csharp
namespace NUnit.Tests
{
  using System;
  using NUnit.Framework;

  [TestFixture]
  public class SuccessTests
  {
    [OneTimeSetUp]
    public void Init()
    { /* ... */ }

    [OneTimeTearDown]
    public void Cleanup()
    { /* ... */ }

    [Test]
    public void Add()
    { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

## Inheritance

The OneTimeTearDown attribute is inherited from any base class. Therefore, if a base
class has defined a OneTimeTearDown method, that method will be called
after any test methods in the derived class.

You may define a OneTimeTearDown method
in the base class and another in the derived class. NUnit will call base
class OneTimeTearDown methods after those in the derived classes.

> [!WARNING]
> If a base class OneTimeTearDown method is overridden in the derived class, NUnit will not call the base class OneTimeTearDown method; NUnit does not anticipate usage that includes hiding the base method. Note that you may have a different name for each method; as long as both have the `[OneTimeTearDown]` attribute present, each will be called in the correct order.

## Notes

* Although it is possible to define multiple `OneTimeTearDown` methods in the same class, you should rarely do so. Unlike methods defined in separate classes in the inheritance hierarchy, the order in which they are executed is not guaranteed.

* `OneTimeTearDown` methods may be async if running under .NET 4.0 or higher.

* `OneTimeTearDown` methods run in the context of the [`TestFixture`](xref:testfixtureattribute) or [`SetUpFixture`](xref:setupfixture-attribute), which is separate from the context of any individual test cases. It's important to keep this in mind when using [`TestContext`](xref:testcontext) methods and properties within the method.

* When using  [`FixtureLifeCycle`](xref:fixturelifecycleattribute) with `LifeCycle.InstancePerTestCase`, the `OneTimeTearDown` method must be static and is only called once. This is required so that the teardown method does not access instance fields or properties that are reset for every test.
