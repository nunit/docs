# Platform

The Platform attribute is used to specify platforms for which a test or fixture
should be run. Platforms are specified using case-insensitive string values
and may be either included or excluded from the run by use of the Include or
Exclude properties respectively. Platforms to be included may alternatively
be specified as an argument to the PlatformAttribute constructor. In either
case, multiple comma-separated values may be specified.

If a test or fixture with the Platform attribute does not satisfy the specified
platform requirements it is skipped. The test does not affect the outcome of
the run at all: it is not considered as ignored and is not even counted in
the total number of tests. _[Ed.: Check this.]_ In the gui, the tree node for the test remains
gray and the status bar color is not affected.

## Test Fixture Syntax

```csharp
namespace NUnit.Tests
{
  using System;
  using NUnit.Framework;

  [TestFixture]
  [Platform("NET-2.0")]
  public class DotNetTwoTests
  {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Test Syntax

```csharp
namespace NUnit.Tests
{
  using System;
  using NUnit.Framework;

  [TestFixture]
  public class SuccessTests
  {
    [Test]
    [Platform(Exclude="Win98,WinME")]
    public void SomeTest()
    { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Platform Specifiers

The following values are recognized as platform specifiers.
They may be expressed in upper, lower or mixed case.

### Operating System

* Win
* Win32
* Win32S
* Win32Windows
* Win32NT
* WinCE

A list of supported platform identifiers can also be obtained from the constant string `PlatformHelper.OSPlatforms` of the NUnit assembly you use. Note that this is for informational purposes only, because the `PlatformHelper` is considered an internal type and shall not be used in production.

* 32-Bit-Process
* 32-Bit-OS (.NET 4.0 and higher only)
* 64-Bit
