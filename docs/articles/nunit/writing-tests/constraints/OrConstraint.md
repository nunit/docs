# Or Constraint

`OrConstraint` combines two other constraints and succeeds if either of them succeeds.

## Constructor

```csharp
OrConstraint(Constraint left, Constraint right)
```

## Syntax

```csharp
<Constraint>.Or.<Constraint>
```

## Examples of Use

[!code-csharp[OrConstraintExamples](~/snippets/Snippets.NUnit/ConstraintExamples.cs#OrConstraintExamples)]

## Evaluation Order and Precedence

Note that the constraint evaluates the sub-constraints left to right, meaning that
`Assert.That(i,Is.Null.Or.GreaterThan(9));` where `i` is a nullable `int` will work for both `12` and `null`. On the
other hand, `Assert.That(i, Is.GreaterThan(9).Or.Null);` will only work for `12`, but throw an exception for `null`, as
`null` cannot be compared to `9`.

The **OrConstraint** has precedence over the **AndConstraint**.
