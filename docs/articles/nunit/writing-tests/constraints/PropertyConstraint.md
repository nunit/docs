# Property Constraint

`PropertyConstraint` tests for the existence of a named property on an object and then applies a constraint test to the
property value.

## Constructor

```csharp
PropertyConstraint(string name, IConstraint baseConstraint)
```

## Syntax

```csharp
Has.Property(string name)... // followed by further constraint syntax
```

## Examples of Use

```csharp
Assert.That(someObject, Has.Property("Version").EqualTo("2.0"));
Assert.That(collection, Has.Property("Count").GreaterThan(10));
Assert.That(collection, Has.Count.GreaterThan(10);
```

As shown in the example, certain common properties are known to NUnit and may be tested using a shorter form. The
following properties are supported:

```csharp
Has.Length...
Has.Count...
Has.Message...
Has.InnerException...
```
