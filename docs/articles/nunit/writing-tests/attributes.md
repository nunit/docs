# Attributes

NUnit uses custom attributes to identify tests. All NUnit attributes are contained in the NUnit.Framework namespace. Each source file that contains tests must include a using statement for that namespace and the project must reference the framework assembly, `nunit.framework.dll`.

This table lists all the attributes supported by NUnit.

| [Sequential Attribute](attributes/sequential.md)          | Generates test cases using values in the order provided, without additional combinations. |
| [SetCulture Attribute](attributes/setculture.md)          | Sets the current Culture for the duration of a test. |
| [SetUICulture Attribute](attributes/setuiculture.md)        | Sets the current UI Culture for the duration of a test. |
| [SetUp Attribute](attributes/setup.md)               | Indicates a method of a TestFixture called just before each test method. |
| [SetUpFixture Attribute](attributes/setupfixture.md)        | Marks a class with one-time setup or teardown methods for all the test fixtures in a namespace. |
| [SingleThreaded Attribute](attributes/singlethreaded.md)      | Marks a fixture that requires all its tests to run on the same thread. |
| [TearDown Attribute](attributes/teardown.md)            | Indicates a method of a TestFixture called just after each test method. |
| [Test Attribute](attributes/test.md)                | Marks a method of a TestFixture that represents a test. |
| [TestCase Attribute](attributes/testcase.md)            | Marks a method with parameters as a test and provides inline arguments. |
