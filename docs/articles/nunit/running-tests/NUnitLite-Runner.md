# NUnite Lite Runner

NUnitLite started out life as a separate version of the NUnit framework, with fewer features and a built-in test runner.
It ran on devices as well as on desktop .NET and mono and allowed users to create executable tests without the overhead
of a full NUnit installation.

With NUnit 3.0, the NUnitLite framework has been merged with the full NUnit framework. There is now only one framework,
**nunit.framework.dll**. The built-in runner, which was a part of the old NUnitLite, is now packaged as
**nunitlite.dll**.

## Using NUnitLite

To run tests under NUnitLite, proceed as follows:

* You can use your existing unit test project (created with the `dotnet new nunit` command or from Visual Studio) or
 create a new console application.  If you use an existing test project you will get a warning about duplicate entry
 points. This can be ignored.

Using a standard test project has the benefit that you can use both the standard `dotnet test` command, the Visual
 Studio Test Explorer and the NUnitLite runner to run your tests.

* Make sure your test assembly references both **nunit.framework** and **nunitlite**.

```xml
<PackageReference Include="NUnitLite" Version="4.0.1" />
<PackageReference Include="NUnit" Version="4.0.1" />
```

Optionally you can set the `OutputType` in a `PropertyGroup` to `Exe`, which allows you to run the tests directly and
 without the `dotnet run`.

```xml
  <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
```

* Add a `Program.cs` containing a top level statements main routine like:

[!code-csharp[ProgramCS](~/snippets/Snippets.NUnitLite/Program.cs)]

If you don't use top-level statements, then just create a standard main routine with the same code.

* Execute your test application in order to run the tests.

```cmd
dotnet run
```

If you install the NUnitLite runner via the NuGet package, steps 2 is handled automatically. Both assemblies are
installed and referenced for you.

## NUnitLite Output

As seen in the following screen shot, the output from an NUnitLite run is quite similar to that from the console runner.
