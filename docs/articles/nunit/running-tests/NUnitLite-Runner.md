# NUnite Lite Runner

NUnitLite started out life as a separate version of the NUnit framework, with fewer features and a built-in test runner. It ran on devices as well as on desktop .NET and mono and allowed users to create executable tests without the overhead of a full NUnit installation.

With NUnit 3.0, the NUnitLite framework has been merged with the full NUnit framework. There
is now only one framework, **nunit.framework.dll**. The built-in runner, which was a part of the old NUnitLite, is now packaged as **nunitlite.dll**.

## Using NUnitLite

To run tests under NUnitLite, proceed as follows:

* Create a console application to use as your test assembly. If you have already placed tests in a dll, you can change the project so that it produces a console application and reload it.

* Make sure your test assembly references both **nunit.framework** and **nunitlite**.

* The Main() for your console application should look something like this...

```csharp
public static int Main(string[] args)
{
  return new AutoRun().Execute(args);
}
```

* Execute your test application in order to run the tests.

If you install the NUnitLite runner via the NuGet package, steps 2 is handled
automatically. Both assemblies are installed and referenced for you.

## NUnitLite Output

As seen in the following screen shot, the output from an NUnitLite run is quite similar to that from the console runner.
