# NUnit Test Projects

Although you may simply enter multiple assembly names on the console command-line, running tests from multiple
assemblies is facilitated by the use of NUnit test projects. These are files with the extension .nunit containing
information about the assemblies to be loaded. The following is an example of a hypothetical test project file:

```xml
<NUnitProject>
  <Settings activeconfig="Debug"/>
  <Config name="Debug">
    <assembly path="LibraryCore\bin\Debug\Library.dll"/>
    <assembly path="LibraryUI\bin\Debug\LibraryUI.dll"/>
  </Config>
  <Config name="Release">
    <assembly path="LibraryCore\bin\Release\Library.dll"/>
    <assembly path="LibraryUI\bin\Release\LibraryUI.dll"/>
  </Config>
</NUnitProject>
```

This project contains two configurations, each of which contains two assemblies. The Debug configuration is currently
active. By default, the assemblies will be loaded using the directory containing this file as the ApplicationBase. The
PrivateBinPath will be set automatically to `LibraryCore\bin\Debug;LibraryUI\bin\Debug` or to the corresponding release
path. XML attributes are used to specify non-default values for the ApplicationBase, Configuration File and
PrivateBinPath.

The [Project Editor](https://github.com/nunit-legacy/nunit-project-editor/wiki/Project-Editor) may be used to create or
modify NUnit projects. If you edit the XML manually, you should make sure to use a path relative to the directory
containing the project file as the location of any assemblies.

## Command-line Overrides

The following command-line options override what is specified in the NUnit project file:

* --config
* --domain
* --process
* --framework
