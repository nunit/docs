# Breaking Changes

## NUnit 4.0

* The [Classic Asserts](../writing-tests/assertions/assertion-models/classic.md) have been moved to a separate library
  and their namespace and their class name were renamed to: `NUnit.Framework.Legacy.ClassicAssert`.
* The standalone assert classes have also been moved to the `NUnit.Framework.Legacy` namespace. These classes are:
  * [CollectionAssert](../writing-tests/assertions/classic-assertions/Collection-Assert.md)
  * [StringAssert](../writing-tests/assertions/classic-assertions/String-Assert.md)
  * [DirectoryAssert](../writing-tests/assertions/classic-assertions/Directory-Assert.md)
  * [FileAssert](../writing-tests/assertions/classic-assertions/File-Assert.md)
* Assert.That overloads with _format_ specification and `params` have been removed in favor of an overload using
  `FormattableString`.
* The lowest framework version supported is now version 4.6.2 and .Net 6.0.

See full list of [deprecated
issues](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/framework.html#deprecated-features) and [breaking
changes](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/framework.html#the-following-issues-are-marked-as-breaking-changes)
in the framework.

## NUnit 3.10

* `NUnit.Framework.Constraints.NUnitEqualityComparer.Default` was deprecated in favor of `new NUnitEqualityComparer()`.

## NUnit 3.8

* Removed some deprecated attributes:

* TestFixtureSetUpAttribute (use OneTimeSetUpAttribute)
* TestFixtureTearDownAttribute (use OneTimeTearDownAttribute)
* RequiresSTAAttribute (use ApartmentAttribute)
* RequiresMTAAttribute (use ApartmentAttribute)

* Removed deprecated Is.StringXxxx syntax elements:

* Is.StringStarting (use Does.StartWith)
* Is.StringEnding (use Does.EndWith)
* Is.StringContaining (use Does.Contain)
* Is.StringMatching (use Does.Match)

## NUnit 3.7

* The AssertionHelper class has now been deprecated. Users can use the
  [NUnit.StaticExpect](https://github.com/fluffynuts/NUnit.StaticExpect) library as a near drop-in replacement.

## NUnit 3.4

Breaking changes introduced in NUnit 3.4

* The `--teamcity` console command-line option now requires the TeamCityEventListener extension to be installed. This
  only affects users who install the extensions individually or copy them to another directory. If you install using the
  Windows installer or the NUnit.Console NuGet package the TeamCity extension is included.

* String arguments in the names of test cases are no longer truncated to 40 characters.

* The .NET 2.0 build of the nunit framework uses a private implementation of System.Linq. NUnit installs the
  NUnit.System.Linq assembly alongside the nunit.framework assembly. If you copy the framework to another location, you
  must ensure that both are copied. The extra assembly is not used in other builds because System.Linq is already
  supported in those environments.

## NUnit 3.0

A relatively large number of features present in NUnit 2.6, were either removed in NUnit 3.0 or had their behavior
modified in a way that will break existing code.

A key change is that the NUnit Test Engine will not recognize a test assembly that does not reference the NUnit
framework directly. Normally, test assemblies use NUnit Asserts, attributes and other Types and methods. However,
certain third-party frameworks are designed to completely isolate the user from the details of NUnit. They mediate
between the test assembly and the NUnit framework in order to run tests. In such a case, NUnit will indicate that the
assembly either contains no tests or the proper driver could not be found. To resolve this situation, simply add one
NUnit attribute or other reference. An assembly-level `ParallelizableAttribute` is useful for this purpose.

Other breaking changes are grouped in the following tables.

### Attributes

|            Name              |          Notes                                        |

| IgnoreAttribute              | The reason is now mandatory |
| RequiredAddinAttribute       | No longer supported. |
| RequiresMTAAttribute         | Deprecated. Use `ApartmentAttribute`                    |

| TestCaseSourceAttribute      | The attribute forms using a string argument to refer to the data source must now use only static fields, properties or methods. |
| TestFixtureAttribute         | Named parameter `Ignore=` now takes a string, giving the reason for ignoring the test. |

| TestFixtureTearDownAttribute | Deprecated. Use `OneTimeTearDownAttribute`.  |
| ValueSourceAttribute         | The source name of the data source must now use only static fields, properties or  methods. |
