# Framework Release

## NUnit 4.0.1 - December 2. 2023

This is a hotfix release for three issues related to targeting windows targets, like `net6.0-windows`.  If you don't use these targets, you can safely ignore this release.

For more details, see the information in the issues below:

### Bug fixes

* [4571](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/4571) NUnit 4: dotnet test behaving differently locally vs on GH Actions (failing). Fixed by team [PR 4574](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/pull/4574)
* [4565](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/4565) Unable to test project targeting net8.0-windows and win-x64 . Fixed by team [PR 4569](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/pull/4569)
* [4564](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/4564) Tests not discovered for .NET Windows-specific TFM without Windows build number. Fixed by team [PR 4569](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/pull/4569)

## NUnit 4.0.0 - November 26. 2023

This release is an incremental improvement of version 3, and can be used
with the same runners as before, although a minor upgrade might be needed for some.

For the `NUnit3TestAdapter`, you
will need version `4.5` to run tests with NUnit 4.

If you use the `NUnit Console`, you will need version `3.15.3` or later (but not any 3.16.X versions)).

The minimum target framework supported is now dotnet framework `4.6.2`, and .net `6.0`.

See the [planning notes](../Towards-NUnit4.md) for more information about the changes.

See the [migration guide](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/Nunit4.0-MigrationGuide.html) for how to move your projects from NUnit 3 to NUnit 4.

## NUnit 3.13.3 - March 20, 2022

This release includes several performance enhancements. [@lahma](https://github.com/lahma) provided a massive speed
improvement for large, parametrized test suites. In addition, equivalency tests with large unsortable collections run
faster by determining if the collections are sortable before attempting to sort them.

We've added several fixes for .NET 6.0 and we've stopped testing NUnit against .NET Core 2.1 which is now out of
support.

There are also several fixes for the new `FixtureLifeCycle` feature and other smaller bug fixes and performance
improvements.

## NUnit 3.13.2 - April 27, 2021

This release fixes a new issue with the `FixtureLifeCycle` attribute where `IDisposable` test fixtures were not being
disposed properly. As always, [@gleb-osokin](https://github.com/gleb-osokin) has been a great help with this new
feature.

It also fixes a long-standing performance issue with `CollectionAssert.AreEquivalent` and the
`CollectionEquivalentConstraint` when comparing large collections. The deep comparison that NUnit performs on the two
collections will always have a worst case bound of O(n^2) but we have optimized it so that the majority of use cases
will be closer to O(n).

We've also made significant optimizations to the OR filters for selecting tests using their full name. This dramatically
improves test performance for large code bases that use `dotnet test`. Thanks to [@pakrym](https://github.com/pakrym)
for his help with this.

## NUnit 3.13.1 - January 31, 2021

This release addresses several misses with the new `FixtureLifeCycle` attribute, switches to using
[SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink) and NuGet
[snupkg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/symbol-packages-snupkg) packages for debugging into
NUnit from your unit tests. It also addresses issues with the time format of ignored and explicit tests in the test
results file.

## NUnit 3.13 - January 7, 2021

The [`FixtureLifeCycle`](xref:fixturelifecycleattribute) attribute has been added to indicate that an instance for a
test fixture or all test fixtures in an assembly should be constructed for each test within the fixture or assembly.

This attribute may be applied to a test fixture (class) or to a test assembly. It is useful in combination with the
[Parallelizable Attribute](xref:parallelizableattribute) so that a new instance of a test fixture is constructed for
every test within the test fixture. This allows tests to run in isolation without sharing instance fields and properties
during parallel test runs. This make running parallel tests easier because it is easier to make your tests thread safe.

This release also fixes several issues running tests in .NET 5.0. If your tests target .NET 5.0, we recommend updating
to this release.

## NUnit 3.12 - May 14, 2019

This release of NUnit finally drops support for .NET 2.0. If your application still targets .NET 2.0, your tests will
need to target at least .NET 3.5. Microsoft ended support for .NET 2.0 on July 12, 2011. Microsoft recommends that
everyone migrate to at least .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 for security and performance fixes.

This release dramatically improves NUnit support for async tests including returning ValueTask and custom tasks from
tests, improved handling of SynchronizationContexts and better exception handling.

The .NET Standard 2.0 version of NUnit continues to gain more functionality that is found in the .NET 4.5 version of the
framework like setting the ApartmentState and enabling Timeout on tests.

## NUnit 3.10.1 - March 12, 2018

Added a namespace to the props file included in the NuGet package to make it compatible with versions of Visual Studio
prior to VS 2017.

## NUnit 3.10 - March 12, 2018

This release adds a .NET Standard 2.0 version of the framework which re-enables most of the features that have been
missing in our earlier .NET Standard builds like parallelism, timeouts, directory and path based asserts, etc. It also
contains numerous bug fixes and smaller enhancements. We've improved our XML docs, fixed performance issues and added
more detail to Multiple Asserts.

This release also contains source-indexed PDB files allowing developers to debug into the NUnit Framework. This allows
you to track down errors or see how the framework works.

In order to support the .NET Standard 2.0 version, the NUnit project switched to the new CSPROJ format and now requires
Visual Studio 2017 to compile. This only effects people contributing to the project. NUnit still supports building and
compiling your tests in older .NET IDEs and NUnit still supports older versions of the .NET Framework back to 2.0. For
contributors, NUnit can now compile all supported targets on Windows, Linux and Mac using the Cake command line build.

## NUnit 3.9 - November 10, 2017

This release addresses numerous parallelization issues that were introduced in 3.8 when method level parallelization was
added. Most of the parallelization issues resolved were tests never completing when using some combinations of parallel
tests and `ApartmentState` not being properly applied to tests in all cases.

## NUnit 3.8.1 - August 28, 2017

This release fixes two critical regressions in the 3.8 release. The first caused the console runner to crash if you are
using test parameters. The second issue caused collection constraints checking for multiple items in a collection to
fail.

### Issues Resolved

* [2386](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2386) Contains.Item() fails for collections in NUnit 3.8
* [2390](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2390) Missing value attribute in test parameters setting causes
  NullReferenceException in console

## NUnit 3.8 - August 27, 2017

This release removes several methods and attributes that were marked obsolete in the original 3.0 release. Support for
iOS and Android has been improved.

An issue that caused unit tests to run slower was addressed as was a bug that prevented the use of Assert.Multiple in
async code.

The Order attribute can now also be applied to the class level to set the order that test fixtures will be run.

## NUnit 3.7.1 - June 6, 2017

This is a hotfix release that addresses occasional hangs when using test parallelization and fixes crashes in NCrunch
prior to version 3.9.

### Issues Resolved

* 2205 NCrunch: System.Xml.XmlException: Root element is missing, when adding NUnit 3.7.0
* 2209 NUnit occasionally hangs when parallelizable TestFixture has OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown

## NUnit 3.7 - May 29, 2017

This release of NUnit expands on parallel test execution to allow test methods to be run in parallel. Please see the
[Parallelizable Attribute](xref:parallelizableattribute) for more information.

NUnit 3.7 also drops the Portable build of the framework and replaces it with a .NET Standard 1.3 version to compliment
the .NET Standard 1.6 version. This change enables several constraints and other features in the .NET Standard builds
that weren't available in portable like Path and Directory based asserts.

The AssertionHelper class has been deprecated because it is seldom used and has not received any of the updates that
Asserts and Constraints receive. If your code is using the AssertionHelper class, we recommend that you migrate your
asserts.

This release of the framework no longer includes builds for Compact Framework or for SilverLight, but adds a .NET
Standard 1.6 build. If anyone still using Compact Framework or SilverLight and would like to continue development on
those versions of the framework, please contact the NUnit team.

### Framework

* .NET Standard 1.6 is now supported
* Adds support for Multiple Assert blocks
* Added the --params option to NUnitLite
* Theories now support Nullable enums
