# Framework Release

## NUnit 3.13.1 - January 31, 2021

This release addresses several misses with the new `FixtureLifeCycle` attribute, switches to using [SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink) and NuGet [snupkg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/symbol-packages-snupkg) packages for debugging into NUnit from your unit tests. It also addresses issues with the time format of ignored and explicit tests in the test results file.

### Issues Resolved

* [3743](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/3743) Parametrized tests do not respect `FixtureLifeCycle.InstancePerTestCase`
* [3745](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/3745) After upgrading to NUnit 3.13.0 the debugger enters NUnit code despite having checked "Enable Just My Code"

## NUnit 3.13 - January 7, 2021

The [`FixtureLifeCycle`](xref:fixturelifecycleattribute) attribute has been added to indicate that an instance for a test fixture or all test fixtures in an assembly should be constructed for each test within the fixture or assembly.

This attribute may be applied to a test fixture (class) or to a test assembly. It is useful in combination with the [Parallelizable Attribute](xref:parallelizableattribute) so that a new instance of a test fixture is constructed for every test within the test fixture. This allows tests to run in isolation without sharing instance fields and properties during parallel test runs. This make running parallel tests easier because it is easier to make your tests thread safe.

This release also fixes several issues running tests in .NET 5.0. If your tests target .NET 5.0, we recommend updating to this release.

## NUnit 3.12 - May 14, 2019

This release of NUnit finally drops support for .NET 2.0. If your application still
targets .NET 2.0, your tests will need to target at least .NET 3.5. Microsoft ended
support for .NET 2.0 on July 12, 2011. Microsoft recommends that everyone migrate
to at least .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 for security and performance fixes.

This release dramatically improves NUnit support for async tests including returning
ValueTask and custom tasks from tests, improved handling of SynchronizationContexts
and better exception handling.

The .NET Standard 2.0 version of NUnit continues to gain more functionality that
is found in the .NET 4.5 version of the framework like setting the ApartmentState
and enabling Timeout on tests.

## NUnit 3.10.1 - March 12, 2018

Added a namespace to the props file included in the NuGet package to make it
compatible with versions of Visual Studio prior to VS 2017.

## NUnit 3.10 - March 12, 2018

This release adds a .NET Standard 2.0 version of the framework which re-enables
most of the features that have been missing in our earlier .NET Standard builds
like parallelism, timeouts, directory and path based asserts, etc. It also contains
numerous bug fixes and smaller enhancements. We've improved our XML docs,
fixed performance issues and added more detail to Multiple Asserts.

This release also contains source-indexed PDB files allowing developers to debug
into the NUnit Framework. This allows you to track down errors or see how the
framework works.

In order to support the .NET Standard 2.0 version, the NUnit project switched to
the new CSPROJ format and now requires Visual Studio 2017 to compile. This only
effects people contributing to the project. NUnit still supports building and
compiling your tests in older .NET IDEs and NUnit still supports older versions
of the .NET Framework back to 2.0. For contributors, NUnit can now compile all
supported targets on Windows, Linux and Mac using the Cake command line build.

## NUnit 3.9 - November 10, 2017

This release addresses numerous parallelization issues that were introduced in 3.8 when method level parallelization was added. Most of the parallelization issues resolved were tests never completing when using some combinations of parallel tests and `ApartmentState` not being properly applied to tests in all cases.

## NUnit 3.8.1 - August 28, 2017

This release fixes two critical regressions in the 3.8 release. The first caused the console runner to crash if you are using test parameters. The second issue caused collection constraints checking for multiple items in a collection to fail.

### Issues Resolved

* [2386](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2386) Contains.Item() fails for collections in NUnit 3.8
* [2390](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2390) Missing value attribute in test parameters setting causes NullReferenceException in console

## NUnit 3.8 - August 27, 2017

This release removes several methods and attributes that were marked obsolete in the
original 3.0 release. Support for iOS and Android has been improved.

An issue that caused unit tests to run slower was addressed as was a bug that prevented
the use of Assert.Multiple in async code.

The Order attribute can now also be applied to the class level to set the order
that test fixtures will be run.

## NUnit 3.7.1 - June 6, 2017

This is a hotfix release that addresses occasional hangs when using test parallelization and fixes crashes in NCrunch prior to version 3.9.

### Issues Resolved

* 2205 NCrunch: System.Xml.XmlException: Root element is missing, when adding NUnit 3.7.0
* 2209 NUnit occasionally hangs when parallelizable TestFixture has OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown

## NUnit 3.7 - May 29, 2017

This release of NUnit expands on parallel test execution to allow test methods to
be run in parallel. Please see the [Parallelizable Attribute](xref:parallelizableattribute)
for more information.

NUnit 3.7 also drops the Portable build of the framework and replaces it with a
.NET Standard 1.3 version to compliment the .NET Standard 1.6 version. This change
enables several constraints and other features in the .NET Standard builds that
weren't available in portable like Path and Directory based asserts.

The AssertionHelper class has been deprecated because it is seldom used and has
not received any of the updates that Asserts and Constraints receive. If your code
is using the AssertionHelper class, we recommend that you migrate your asserts.

### Issues Resolved

### Framework

* .NET Standard 1.6 is now supported
* Adds support for Multiple Assert blocks
* Added the --params option to NUnitLite
* Theories now support Nullable enums
* Improved assert error messages to help differentiate differences in values
* Added warnings with Warn.If(), Warn.Unless() and Assert.Warn()
* Enabled Path, File and Directory Asserts/Constraints for .NET Core testing
* Added NonTestAssemblyAttribute for use by third-party developers to indicate that their assemblies reference the NUnit framework, but do not contain tests
