# NUnit Documentation

This documentation covers NUnit 3.0 and higher.

Where applicable, we have marked sections with the version in which a feature first appeared.

If you are new to NUnit, we suggest you begin by reading the Getting Started section of this site. Those who have used
earlier releases may want to begin with the Upgrading section.

See the [Release Notes](xref:frameworkreleasenotes) for more information on each release.
