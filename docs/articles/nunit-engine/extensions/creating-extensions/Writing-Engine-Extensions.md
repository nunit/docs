# Writing Engine Extensions

This page gives general information that applies to all types of extensions you may want to write. The individual pages for each type of extension give specific details.

## Extension structure

Every extension is implemented by a class with specific characteristics:

* Has a default constructor so that NUnit can create an instance.
* Implements some interface that varies according to the particular extension.
* Is marked with the `ExtensionAttribute` so that NUnit can recognize it as an extension.

As an example, the code for an `IProjectLoader` extension might look like this:

```csharp
[Extension]
public class MyExtension : IProjectLoader
{
    public MyExtenions()
    {
        /* ... */
    }

    /* ... */
}
```

## Extension Attribute

The `ExtensionAttribute` has four named properties, all optional:

* **Path** This is a string that uniquely identifies the extension point to which the extension applies. It is only rarely needed, since NUnit can usually deduce the type of extension based on what interface is implemented by the extension class.

* **Description** An optional description of what the extension does.

* **Enabled** A boolean flag indicating whether the extension is enabled. This defaults to true. The setting is used by advanced extensions with functionality that is turned on and off depending on user input.

* **EngineVersion** The minimum engine version supported by the extension. Although optional, you should use this property if your extension will not work with all versions of the engine. If you don't use it and your extension requires engine services that are not present, then it might throw an exception or cause other errors.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Only engine versions 3.4 or later check the `EngineVersion` property. The only way to avoid errors in the case of lower engine versions is to not install such extensions.

## ExtensionPropertyAttribute

The `ExtensionPropertyAttribute` is used to provide additional meta-data to the engine, without the need for the engine to load each extension. The usages of `ExtensionPropertyAttribute` differ per type of extension.

Below is an example of how the attribute would be used for an `IProjectLoader` extension:

```csharp
[Extension]
[ExtensionProperty("FileExtension", ".nunit")]
public class NUnitProjectLoader : IProjectLoader
{
    /* ... */
}
```

By use of the `ExtensionPropertyAttribute` NUnit is able to postpone loading the extension until the user actually uses a file of type `.nunit`. If the extension is never needed, then it won't be loaded at all. For information about what properties are used by each extension point, see the individual pages for each type of extension.

> [!NOTE]
> Extensions are usually created each in their own assembly for efficiency. It's possible to have several related extensions in the same assembly, but they will all be loaded into memory as soon as one is used.
