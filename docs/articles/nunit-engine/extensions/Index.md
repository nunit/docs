# NUnit Engine Extensions

NUnit has [several extensions to the engine currently available](xref:availableengineextensions).

We've also made it possible to [create your own](xref:creatingengineextensionsindex).

Once you obtain or create an extension, you'll need to [install the extension into the engine](xref:installingextensions).
