we are releasing version 3.16 of the engine and console runner.

## NUnit Console & Engine 3.13 - November 30, 2021

This is the first release of the NUnit Console Runner, `nunit3-console.exe`, which allows running of both .NET Framework and .NET Core tests,
either separately or in combination. The `nunit3-console.exe` runner executes under the .NET Framework but is able to launch .NET Core agents
and communicate with them over a TCP connection.

A second major feature in this release is engine support for preemptive cancellation when the normal approach of requesting the test run to
self-terminate doesn't work. This is an engine feature, available to any runners supporting cancellation.

## NUnit Console & Engine 3.12 - January 17, 2021

## .NET Core NUnit Console 3.12 Beta 2  - January 17, 2021

This release contains various improvements to running tests on .NET Core and Mono, and changes to
extension loading logic to allow the Engine to better support extensions which target multiple platforms. There are additionally
a number of fixes to issues that were identified with 3.12 Beta 1. Please also be aware that this will be the last version of
the NUnit Engine to support .NET Standard 1.6.

The .NET Core Console remains in Beta due to some unresolved dependency loading and framework targeting issues - contributions to
fix these issues would be very welcome!

Code contributions in this release were included from [Charlie Poole](https://github.com/CharliePoole), [Chris Maddock](https://github.com/ChrisMaddock), [Christian Bay](https://github.com/tdctaz), [Eberhard Beilharz](https://github.com/ermshiperete), [Ed Ball](https://github.com/ejball), [Joseph Musser](https://github.com/jnm2), [Manohar Singh](https://github.com/mano-si), [Mattias Cavigelli](https://github.com/mcavigelli) and [Mikkel Nylander Bundgaard](https://github.com/mikkelbu). Thank you to all those who contributed both in code, and otherwise.

## NUnit Console & Engine 3.12 Beta 1 - August 1, 2020

This is the first beta release of the NUnit Console able to run .NET Core Tests. In addition to this, this release also contains a number of bug fixes, improvements when running on Mono and significant refactoring work towards the goal of creating an engine able to run tests on a wider range of .NET platforms.

We're particularly interested in this beta release being tested by users of the .NET Core console and users running tests on Mono. Please feedback any issues to the [nunit-console repository](https://github.com/nunit/nunit-console/issues).

The .NET Core Console is a separate executable to the original version, and can be found in either the .zip file download, or the new [NUnit.ConsoleRunner.NetCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit.ConsoleRunner.NetCore/) NuGet package. Our longer-term aim is to create a single console which is able to run both .NET Core and .NET Framework tests.

Code contributions in this release were included from [Charlie Poole](https://github.com/CharliePoole), [Chris Maddock](https://github.com/ChrisMaddock), [Christian Bay](https://github.com/tdctaz), [Eberhard Beilharz](https://github.com/ermshiperete), [Joseph Musser](https://github.com/jnm2), [Manohar Singh](https://github.com/mano-si) and [Mikkel Nylander Bundgaard](https://github.com/mikkelbu).

## NUnit Console 3.10 - March 24, 2019

This release merges the .NET Standard version of the engine back into the nunit.engine
NuGet package and adds a .NET Standard 2.0 version of the engine that re-enables most
services and extensions. This deprecates the `nunit.engine.netstandard` NuGet package.
Any test runners using the old .NET Standard version of the engine should switch to
this release.

The `--params` command line option which took multiple test parameters separated by
a semicolon is now deprecated in favor of the new `--testparam` command line option.
One of the most common uses for test parameters was to pass connection strings into
tests but this required workarounds to handle the semicolons. Now you must pass in
each test parameter separately using a `--testparam` or `--tp` option for each.

## NUnit Console 3.9 - September 5, 2018

This release should stop the dreaded SocketException problem on shutdown. The
console also no longer returns -5 when AppDomains fail to unload at the end of a
test run. These fixes should make CI runs much more stable and predictable.

For developers working on the NUnit Console and Engine project, Visual Studio
2017 update 5 or newer is now required to compile on the command line. This does
not effect developers using NUnit or the NUnit Console, both of which support building
and running your tests in any IDE and on any .NET Framework back to .NET 2.0.
