# The Teams in the NUnit Project

The NUnit project is made up of several teams, each with its own focus and responsibilities, and with a set of team
members.

The team members are a bunch of dedicated people from all over the globe, who are passionate about NUnit and want to
make it better. They are all volunteers, and they do this in their spare time.
