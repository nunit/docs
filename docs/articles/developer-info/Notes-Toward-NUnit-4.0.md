# Notes Toward NUnit 4.0

This page describes plans for the next major releases of NUnit, focusing on major changes we expect to make.

Also see [Towards NUnit 4](xref:towardsnunit4) for more details on the changes.

## Extensions

With the release of nunit3-console 4.0, we intend to stop distributing the **teamcity-event-listener** bundled with the console as a standard extension. We will continue to support the `--teamcity` option in the console runner when the extension is installed separately by the user.
