The adapter is shipped with two different versions of the test framework. The first is the full framework version, which
is used for .NET Framework based test projects.  The second is the .NET (Core)  version, which is used for .NET Core
1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0 and upwards.  The different versions of the adapter supports different
versions of the test framework.  The table above shows the supported versions.

Version 4.3.2 of the adapter will support future versions of .net, as long as there are no breaking changes.  (Earlier
versions have been blocking that based on the table above).

The included versions are as shown below, only the versions where changes are done are listed.

| Adapter version | .NET framework version | .NET (core) version | Comment |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.8 | 3.5 | 1.0 | Some versions included 2.0 too |
| 3.16.0 | 3.5 | 2.1 | |
|4.3.1|3.5|3.1||
|4.4.0|4.6.2|3.1||
