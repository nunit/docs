# Adapter V3 Release Notes

## NUnit3 Test Adapter for Visual Studio - Version 3.17.0 - July 11, 2020

This release has a series of enhancements and bugfixes.  There have been two 3.17 beta releases (beta.1 and beta.2) published earlier on nuget.org.
A major bugfix is that the console output now is properly appearing.  There are also a series of fixes for corner cases.  

[StopOnError](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/vs-test-adapter/Tips-And-Tricks.html#stoponerror) can be very useful to reduce time of long test runs that are failing.

The ability to set custom paths for the test code can be useful with data driven tests, where you want to point to the data file (and line number therein) instead of the default C# test code.

See [here for all details](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/vs-test-adapter/Tips-And-Tricks.html) on the settings.

## NUnit3 Test Adapter for Visual Studio - Version 3.16.1 - January 16, 2020

This release is a hotfix release intended to fix three major issues:

* [686](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/686) NUnit3TestAdapter3.16. dotnet filter argument is not applied
* [690](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/690) Can run only one test case from combinatorial test
* [692](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/692) NUnit Test Adaptor 3.16.0 never displays results of test under Visual Studio 2015

Together with these, the following issues are changed:

* [676](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/676)  Test cases are skipped with TestCaseSource under Visual Studio 2019.  This works under 3.16.0, but need the changes below in a runsettings file under 3.16.1

Note that this hotfix changes some of the new defaults introduced in 3.16.0.  
These can be set back using the two new runsettings [UseParentFQNForParametrizedTests](xref:tipsandtricks#useparentfqnforparametrizedtests) and [UseNUnitIdforTestCaseId](xref:tipsandtricks#usenunitidfortestcaseid)

-----

## NUnit3 Test Adapter for Visual Studio - Version 3.16.0 - January 3, 2020

This release has three major changes.  

1. The support for .NET Core `1.*` has been removed.  This is done to open up more functionality for the later .NET Core versions.  Also, since .NET Core `1.*` is no longer supported by Microsoft, we decided to remove the support too.  If you do have .NET Core 1.* solutions and can't upgrade, you should stay with the the adapter 3.15.1 or lower.  The change also means we now support dump files in .NET Core :-).  It also means the total size of the package has been reduced by around 30%.

2. The filter syntax issues we've had with special names and characters have been mostly solved, thanks to excellent work by [John M.Wright](https://github.com/johnmwright).  The filter syntax is now closer to a correct FQN (Full Qualified Name), but this might cause some issues with your own filter in some rare cases.  The fix done resolves a lot of issues, all of them listed below.  For a detailed explanation of what has been done, see the [Pull Request #668](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/668).

3. You can now use the NUnit filter syntax, either from command line or through settings in the runsettings file. This was due to an idea by [Michael Letterle](https://github.com/mletterle) and a subsequent implementation [Pull Request #669](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/669).  Michael also wrote [a great blog post](https://blog.prokrams.com/2019/12/16/nunit3-filter-dotnet/) to explain how this works, and how he arrived at the solution.  For more information see the [NUnit Test Selection Language](xref:testselectionlanguage).

### Resolved issues

**All the following are solved by [Pull Request #668](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/668)**  

* [622](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/622)  An exception occurred while invoking executor 'executor://nunit3testexecutor/': Incorrect format for TestCaseFilter Error: Missing ')'
* [549](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/549) Invalid characters in test name breaks test runner
* [607](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/607) VS Test Explorer does not show results for test cases that have custom names
* [613](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/613) TestCaseSource tests get wrongly displayed
* [672](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/672) VS Test Explorer fails to run tests with test cases mocked with NSubstitute
* [644](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/644) Test Explorer shows excess class name for tests with multiple TestCaseAttribute
* [615](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/515) Dynamic TestCaseSource from reflection are not listed as sub-tests of the test method

**The following are resolved (fully or partially) by [Pull Request #669](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/669)**

* [655](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/655)  How to run parameterized NUnit tests on .NET Core?
* [425](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/425)  Partly resolved using NUnit Test Selection Language. Run only specific tests when using dotnet test?

### The following is also resolved, but can't repro the original

* [582](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/582) TestCase with enclosed double quotes error

### Other resolved issues

* [679](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/679) Build.cake does not work in a pure visual studio preview installation.  Fixed by [PR #680](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/680) by [Ove Bastiansen](https://github.com/ovebastiansen)

-----

## NUnit3 Test Adapter for Visual Studio - Version 3.15.1 - August 30, 2019

This is a hotfix release due to some issues with special cases in NUnit, causing the tests to not run.
The major difference is that this release makes PreFiltering which was introduced in 3.15, optional - and default off. It can be enabled by setting PreFilter to true in a runsettings file.

### Resolved Issues

* [651](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/651)  Add feature flag to enable/disable pre-filtering.  This one contains the links to the issues below:

* [648](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/648) NUnit3TestAdapter 3.15.0 fails to run test: "NUnit failed to load" (when using NUnit framework  less than version 3.11)
* [649](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/649) NUnit3TestAdapter 3.15 OneTimeSetUp not working anymore  (When a SetupFixture is being used)
* [650](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/650) NUnit3TestAdapter 3.15 not running tests with custom TestCaseSource (when using SetName instead of SetArgDisplayNames)

-----

## NUnit3 Test Adapter for Visual Studio - Version 3.15 - August 23, 2019

This release is a major performance improvement release.  When used from Visual Studio, and used with a selection of tests, it will significantly speed up the discovery of those.  Note that discovery is also a part of the execution, so you will also see the performance improvement for execution.  It will be mostly noticeable when you have a large set of tests.  

### Features and Enhancements

* [529](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/529)  Use framework prefilter for massive perf improvement when running fraction of tests.  Thanks to [MatthewBeardmore](https://github.com/MatthewBeardmore) for the [Pull request](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/553) and patience

### Resolved Issues

* [645](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/645) NUnit3TestAdapter 3.14.0 includes NUnit3.TestAdapter.dll versioned 3.13.  Version number of dll corrected to match package version 3.15
* [580](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/580) Fix licenseUrl in nuspec, will be deprecated

-----

## NUnit3 Test Adapter for Visual Studio - Version 3.14 - August 8, 2019

### Features and Enhancements

* [609](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/609) Request to change working directory from Windows/System32 to another directory
and
  [303](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/303) Directory.GetCurrentDirectory is C:\WINDOWS\system32 for NUnit3TestAdapter.  If your current directory points to either Windows directory or the Program Files folders, it will be redirected to your temp folder.
* [621](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/621) TestContext.Progress output.  It will only go to the console, not the test output.
* [222](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/222) NUnit3TestAdapter errors when running xUnit tests.  Thanks to [nvborisenko](https://github.com/nvborisenko) for the [Pull Request](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/624)

### Resolved Issues

* [629](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/629) NUnit3TestAdapter errors when running xUnit tests
* [630](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/630) Assert.Multiple produces new tests in the report if inner assertions fail.  Thanks again to [nvborisenko](https://github.com/nvborisenko) for the [Pull Request](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/631)

### Comments

This version also includes the latest version 3.10 of the NUnit.Engine.dll

-----

## NUnit3 Test Adapter for Visual Studio - Version 3.13 - February 20, 2019

This release focuses on producing NUnit test result XML which can be useful when you need reports using tools that support the NUnit format.  This can be enabled using [a new setting](xref:tipsandtricks#testoutputxml) in the [runsettings file](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OsirisTerje.Runsettings-19151).  

The VSIX is also made compatible with the upcoming VS 2019. Please note support for the VSIX is being deprecated in Visual Studio, and we strongly recommend you to change your test projects to use the [NuGet adapter version](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit3TestAdapter/).

The [NUnit internal properties](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/blob/master/src/NUnitFramework/framework/Internal/PropertyNames.cs) have been "over-populating" in the Test Explorer.  These are now filtered out, although you may still see these when you have [Source Based Discovery (SBD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/test-explorer-faq?view=vs-2017) turned on (which is the default in VS).  Once you have run, they will be gone. We expect this part of the issue (SBD) to be fixed in VS.

If you still want to see the properties, you can enable that again setting a runsettings property `ShowInternalProperties` to true.

### Enhancements

* [323](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/323)  Add support for producing XML test results in NUnit format
* [474](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/474)  Skip surfacing certain properties as UI groupings  (Internal NUnit properties are no longer visible in Test Explorer)
* [590](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/590)  Support for Visual Studio 2019 (VSIX)

### Resolved Issues

* [302](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/302) BadImageFormatException building solution with unmanaged projects) Extra fix for this, see [PR 592](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/pull/592) Issue302 native execution in execution. Thanks to [Oski Kervinen](https://github.com/OskiKervinen-MF) for fixing this.  
* [596](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/596)  TestOutputXml should handle relative paths relative to the `Workfolder`
* [600](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/600)  TestOutputXml setting ignored on netcore2.1, works on net461

### Other fixes

* [599](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/599)   Url in the repo header pointing to [nunit.org](https://nunit.org) changed to https, also some other similar changes other places.  Thanks to [Julian Verdurmen](https://github.com/304NotModified) for fixing these.
