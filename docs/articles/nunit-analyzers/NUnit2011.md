## Description

Using constraints instead of boolean methods will lead to better assertion messages in case of failure.

## Motivation

Using `Does.Contain` (or `Does.Not.Contain`) constraint will lead to better assertion messages in case of failure,
so this analyzer marks all usages of string `Contains` method where it is possible to replace
with `Does.Contain` constraint.

```csharp
[Test]
public void Test()
{
    string actual = "...";
    string expected = "...";
    Assert.True(actual.Contains(expected));
}
```

## How to fix violations

The analyzer comes with a code fix that will replace `Assert.True(actual.Contains(expected))` with
`Assert.That(actual, Does.Contain(expected))`. So the code block above will be changed into

```csharp
[Test]
public void Test()
{
    string actual = "...";
    string expected = "...";
    Assert.That(actual, Does.Contain(expected));
}
```

## Configure severity

### Via ruleset file.

Configure the severity per project, for more info see [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264949.aspx).

### Via #pragma directive.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable NUnit2011 // Use ContainsConstraint for better assertion messages in case of failure.
Code violating the rule here
#pragma warning restore NUnit2011 // Use ContainsConstraint for better assertion messages in case of failure.
```

Or put this at the top of the file to disable all instances.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable NUnit2011 // Use ContainsConstraint for better assertion messages in case of failure.
```

### Via attribute `[SuppressMessage]`.

```csharp
[System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage("Assertion",
    "NUnit2011:Use ContainsConstraint for better assertion messages in case of failure.",
    Justification = "Reason...")]
```
<!-- end generated config severity -->
