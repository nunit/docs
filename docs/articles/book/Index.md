# Automated Testing & TDD with NUnit: An On-Ramp

## About This Series

### Who is it for?

This series aims to be for everyone -- from people who've never written a unit test to people who have used NUnit but would like to brush up on some of the theory and practices.

We'll try to split up the articles so that you can dive in and focus on the parts that you care about. And we'll try to use real-world examples along the way.

We'll also try to make it as succinct as possible, because we're not getting paid by the word -- or indeed, at all :) -- for this.

### Strong Opinions, Loosely Held

This guide is naturally going to reflect the opinions of the primary author. However, along the way, we'll try to point out where another school of thought might approach something differently.

One thing for sure that we want to be clear about: there are several ways to do testing well, and there is no "one true way" to do it right, especially because the context and trade-offs of each project and team are unique. We'll do our best to not present opinion as fact, and we'll work toward including more adjacent insight as we build out the guide.

Similarly, we're not trying to "sell" you on TDD. We find value in it in many cases, so we'll talk about it. Similarly, NUnit is a great library for testing -- but it's by no means the only one, and alternatives like xUnit are quite popular (even with us!). To each their own; we hope if nothing else, some of the theory and practical tips here will be useful no matter which library you choose.

### What Tech Stack Are You Using?

We're writing this primarily from the perspective of .NET Core and onward, because with .NET 5 this is the path forward that the .NET team has chosen for the technology. With that said, we'll absolutely augment this guide with tips and explainers for those who are on the classic .NET Framework, and if any of what we say doesn't work for you,

## This is a Living Thing. Have Feedback or Improvements?

No improvement to this will happen without you. If you have a question, chances are someone else will too -- please ask! If you have an improvement, we'd love to hear about it. [Create an issue in the docs repository](https://www.notion.so/seankilleen/TBD) to start a conversation.

## Possible Future Directions

It's possible this could expand to the point where it makes sense to stand it up on its own. If that happens, maybe it will move out of the NUnit docs and over to somewhere else.

## Credit Where It's Due

We've read a lot about testing over the years from a lot of places. Wherever we are aware (or are made aware) of credit being owed for a particular contribution, we'll be sure to cite it. Much of the knowledge here is considered general, mainstream knowledge in the industry. If you are reading this and think someone needs to be cited to receive credit for something, by all means -- let us know!
