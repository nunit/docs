This repository contains this `Dockerfile`.\n\nThe `Dockerfile` does a few things:\n\n* Specifies the image we pull from (our own container, which we use for builds, that contains `docfx` built using `mono`)\n* Exposes the port we'll need to serve the docs site\n* Installs node and all of the node-based tools we use in our GitHub Actions\n* Adds command aliases to make the environment easier to use\n",

      "description": "## Viewing the Site\n\nWhen you begin working on the docs, you may want to view the site.\n\n* First, serve the site if you haven't already:\n\n>> serve\n\n* GitHub Codespaces will show you a message that a site has become available at port `8080`, and will present a button click to go there\n* Click the button. A new browser window will open, and the site will display.\n\nNOTE: Subsequent changes will not be detected; `docfx` does not currently have a `watch` option. You will need to exit the process and run `serve` again upon making changes.\n"
